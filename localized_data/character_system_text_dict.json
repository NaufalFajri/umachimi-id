    "91003": "The turf on the track is always so lush. I guess that means we should be grateful to the groundskeepers.",
    "91004": "I hope this beautiful weather continues. I can't run for very long in the rain because my body gets cold.",
    "91005": "I need to be careful so that my stomach doesn't get cold.",

    "91008": "Wh-what should I do? As soon as I put on my signature racewear, I get the urge to race!",
    "91009": "When I set my alarm sound to a fanfare, I always wake up feeling fantastic. Hehe!",
    "91010": "I end up eating more than usual when I'm with Spe. What should I do?",
    "91011": "When I close my eyes before going to sleep, I see all the scenery I've run through.",

    "91013": "One for jogging in the morning, one for training in the afternoon, and one for running at night... I need so many towels.",
    "91014": "Come to think of it, a burr got stuck to my clothes the other day. Perhaps it was because I was running in the forest... <i>Sigh...</i>",
    "91015": "Seeing the snow calms me. It's so peaceful and pretty... oh, and it's also fun to run through piled-up snow.",
    "92000": "I can run whenever, and that includes right now.",

    "92002": "I don't want to lose to anyone when it comes to running, so please give me some tough training.",

    "92011": "I'm ready. Shall we begin?",
    "92005": "I can feel myself improving little by little. I must make sure not to forget this feeling.",
    "92006": "I wonder what scenery I'll be able to see if I keep improving like this?",
    "92007": "Even something minor can change the scenery you see... I feel as though you taught me that.",
    "93000": "I've managed to see scenery I never could have if I was all on my own.",

    "20000": "Ngh... I feel a little tired.",
    "20001": "Sorry, could I rest for a bit?",
    "20002": "Ho, ho, hee, hoo! Oh, this? It's what I'm like when I'm feeling on top of my game. You'll see what I mean!",
    "20003": "This feeling... Yup. I'm ready for some training!",
    "20004": "I've eaten my fill, so I'm ready for training!",
    "20005": "Mmm... I feel great today. Hit me with whatever you've got!",
    "20006": "All right, what's first on today's agenda?",
    "20007": "Okay, I'm ready for anything.",
    "20008": "I feel terrible. I probably didn't get enough sleep...",
    "20009": "Ugh... I feel so weak. I should have eaten more...",
    "20010": "Ngh... Ah, sorry. My heart's just not in it today.",
    "20011": "My body's been feeling so sluggish recently... This isn't... like me at all...",
    "20021": "Another race? Okay. I'll just have to run with everything I've got.",
    "20022": "I can't keep racing like this... I'd like to skip this one if possible.",
    "20023": "I'm in peak condition. Thank you, Trainer!",
    "20024": "I hope the folks back home are watching!",
    "20025": "Ho, ho, hee, hoo! I feel amazing! What are your orders?",
    "20026": "I feel good. Now all that's left is to win.",
    "20027": "Okay, I'm feeling good. Now I can focus on the race.",
    "20028": "Feels like I can get some great results today. Watch me, Trainer!",
    "20029": "It's almost time. Watch me, Trainer. I'll give it my all.",
    "20030": "I'm a little nervous... I'll have to watch my pacing.",
    "20031": "As long as I do what I learned in training, there's no way I'll lose.",
    "20032": "Things aren't perfect, but... I'll give it my all anyway.",
    "20033": "I feel a little off... I'll need your complete support this time, Trainer.",
    "20034": "Even if I'm a little out of my depth, I'm still gonna run with everything I have!",
    "20035": "At my current level, I—no! Whatever the case, all I can do is give it my best.",
    "20036": "Can I really live up to everyone's expectations? No, that's the wrong attitude. I just have to give it everything I've got.",
    "20037": "These are formidable opponents... They're all faster than me. However, a match isn't decided until the very end!",
    "20038": "All right, let's do it.",
    "20039": "Watch over me.",
    "20040": "Leave it to me.",
    "20041": "Time to study, huh?",
    "20042": "I don't feel very good...",
    "20043": "This is hard...",
    "20046": "Where are we going?",
    "20047": "I-it's the sea...",
    "20049": "Thanks, I feel stronger.",
    "20050": "Thank you for everything you've done for me.",
    "30000": "Second place? That's not too bad.",
    "30001": "Hmm... At least I placed.",
    "30002": "I fell one step short...",
    "30003": "I hate that I'm so weak...",
    "60000": "It's finally time. I'm gonna give it my all!",
    "60001": "My heart's racing... But I'm fine!",
    "70001": "I remember feeling completely lost when I first arrived at the academy. I'm grateful for all the help you gave me.",
    "90000": "Good morning. Have you gotten breakfast yet? If not, let's go together. I'm still a bit hungry myself.",
    "90001": "I need to get even faster... Let's make it happen, Trainer.",
    "90002": "Let's do some afternoon training. I'm full of food <i>and</i> energy.",
    "90003": "Lunch break is way too short. Have you seen the size of the cafeteria's menu?",
    "90004": "<i>Sigh...</i> I'm ready to hit the sack. I have to be in perfect shape for training, after all.",
    "90005": "You're up late. You're always such a hard worker, Trainer.",
    "90006": "Spring makes me feel so warm and fuzzy. I'm always napping and taking walks. Sometimes I even forget to go to class...",
    "90007": "I always feel the breeze when I'm running, but once I stop, I get so hot... Guess that means I should run forever.",
    "90008": "The weather is so nice this time of year, but my stomach becomes a bottomless pit... I wonder what I should have today.",
    "90009": "Apparently a cold's going around. One sneeze and we'll be doomed. I don't want to get sick, so we both better stay vigilant.",
    "91000": "I had a fight with Tama... What do you think? Does pineapple belong on pizza or not?",
    "91001": "Hm... Creek was patting me on the head in the hallway just now... Did I have bedhead or something?",
    "91002": "I got a letter from back home. I wonder what I should write back... I have so much to say.",
    "91003": "I really like the cafeteria, but everyone always looks at me when I order... Am I doing something wrong?",
    "91004": "Everyone seems to know how to use phones so well. Aren't they surprised when it suddenly vibrates?",
    "91005": "Trainer, take my picture, please. I want to show my outfit to my family, but I don't know how to use a camera...",
    "91006": "I want to show the folks back home how much I've grown. I'm sure they'll be proud.",
    "91007": "This outfit is my brand. People can recognize me even from afar. Now all I have to do is give them something to watch.",
    "91008": "It's so easy to move in this outfit. It's almost like it's telling me to get out there and run!",
    "91009": "Yeah, this feels great. I'm definitely an early bird. The morning air just feels so nice.",
    "91010": "I had lunch with Inari, but she scarfed her food down in seconds. That can't be healthy...",
    "91011": "Run a lot, eat a lot, and then all that's left is... sleep a lot.",
    "91012": "I want to see the cherry blossoms with everyone. Food just tastes better when you've got people to share with... What about the flowers? What about them?",
    "91013": "Tama taught me how to make ice cream by freezing juice. Isn't that amazing?!",
    "91014": "When I think of fall, I think of saury, roasted sweet potatoes, and persimmons... What a great season! I love it!",
    "91015": "It's starting to get cold lately. Which means it's time for hot pot. A hot pot under a warm kotatsu... Yeah, that sounds perfect!",
    "92000": "Time for training, right? What should we do today?",
    "92001": "I'll master any task you throw at me.",
    "92002": "I did my stretches, so I'm all ready for training. Let me know whenever.",
    "92003": "The key to getting faster is all about persevering day by day.",
    "92011": "You don't need to go easy on me. I'm pretty tough, you know.",
    "92005": "I want to give a performance that does this outfit justice. So cook up a routine that's perfect for me, Trainer.",
    "92006": "I've got to practice hard and make the folks back home proud. Here goes nothing.",
    "92007": "Don't go easy on me. Give me a regimen that'll help me win, and I'll do it.",
    "93000": "You know... I'm so glad I came here.",
    "93001": "Did I meet your expectations?",
    "95000": "Mm... This feels good.",
    "95001": "Mm... I feel faster.",
    "95003": "I'm Oguri Cap. Nice to meet you.",
    "95004": "I came here to become the best runner possible.",
    "1008": "Come on, guys, let’s show 'em what we're made of!",
    "1019": "I'm glad you're here, Creek.",
    "1020": "Let's do this, Tama.",
    "1049": "Yeah, bring it on.",
    "1000": "Let's go for the win!",
    "1001": "All right.",
    "1003": "I suppose these things happen...",
    "1002": "Darn it all...",
    "1004": "We won!",
    "1007": "Looks like it's a new high score.",
    "1006": "I suppose these things happen...",
    "1005": "Darn it all...",
    "120000": "I'm bursting with power!",
    "140000": "I'm counting on you!",
    "140001": "Yes! You got it!",
    "140002": "Ngh...",
    "140003": "Yeah, this was fun!",
    "140004": "You got quite a lot.",
    "140005": "It's really hard, huh?",
    "140006": "Yeah, this was fun!",
    "140007": "You got quite a lot.",
    "140008": "Hehe.",
    "140009": "Huh?",
    "140010": "Mmm...",
    "140011": "Incredible!",
    "140014": "Ughhh...",
    "140015": "Oh...",
    "140016": "Come on!",
    "140013": "...!",
    "140017": "No...",
    "140018": "Darn it!",
    "40000": "This is... my full power!",
    "40001": "Watch me... This is... my... My full power!",
    "30004": "All right! Ngh... I'm so hungry.",
    "30005": "That was... amazing! Yes!",
    "31000": "Here I go!",
    "13": "Here's today's login bonus.",
    "15": "And here's what to expect tomorrow.",
    "110000": "Training? I can start whenever you're ready.",
    "110001": "So much has happened...",
    "110002": "Are we going to enter a race?",
    "10021": "Looks like your Umamusume Archive level has gone up.",
    "20051": "Okay, let's do it together.",
    "70000": "Trainer... I trust you.",
    "95005": "If I want to help out, I better work hard.",
    "95006": "Now I can help even more.",
    "70004": "Okay, everything checks out.",
    "70010": "Am I pulling this outfit off?",
    "70008": "Isn't this a little too... flashy?",
    "70014": "I hope it looks good on me...",
    "70009": "Okay, now both my body and mind are ready.",
    "70015": "My chest feels like it's on fire when I wear this!",
    "71004": "Okay, everything checks out.",
    "71010": "Am I pulling this outfit off?",
    "71008": "Isn't this a little too... flashy?",
    "71014": "I hope it looks good on me...",
    "71009": "Okay, now both my body and mind are ready.",
    "71015": "My chest feels like it's on fire when I wear this!",
    "2030": "Let's go for the win!",
    "2031": "Come on, guys, let’s show 'em what we're made of!",
    "2032": "Thank you for everything you've done for me.",
    "2033": "Feels like I can get some great results today. Watch me, Trainer!",
    "2034": "Ho, ho, hee, hoo! I feel amazing! What are your orders?",
    "2035": "Thank you for everything you've done for me.",
    "90010": "I like this outfit. It has words of encouragement written on the inside that give me strength every morning.",
    "90011": "Morning. Have you checked your bedside? Santa might've paid you a visit.",
    "90012": "Something's been on my mind. I was in the cafeteria, and when I said I wanted to eat a big chicken, El ran away. Did I say something wrong?",
    "90013": "It feels so nice to bask in the sun, I could just melt... I wonder if this is what it feels like to be a snowman.",
    "90014": "Don't overdo it, okay? If you stay up too late, he'll think you're a naughty kid and you won't get any presents.",
    "90015": "I wish I could run through the night sky... Then there'd be no limit to how far I could run...",
    "90016": "Ugh, I thought I climbed a fir tree, but it was actually a cedar. You might want to stay away from me if you have hay fever.",
    "90017": "You know, I heard that Santa does surfing during the summer. Maybe I should start learning with Hayahide.",
    "90018": "Did you know? You can eat pine cones. So that means... wreaths can double up as emergency food.",
    "90019": "Trainer, have you ever tried ice skating? If not, I can teach you. I'm pretty good.",
    "91016": "Tama says they make takoyaki at her house for the winter holidays... Next year, we're heading to Tama's room, all right?",
    "91017": "Hayahide looks just like Santa in her red costume... Especially from the back.",
    "91018": "I'd like to race against Santa's reindeer sometime... I bet they're fast!",
    "91019": "Creek is unsure about how to wash this costume. I wish I could help somehow...",
    "91020": "They say candles help you have a good night's sleep. Watch out though. If you put them too close to you, you'll end up looking like a red-nosed reindeer.",
    "91028": "This star decoration... it's nice. Looking at it fills me with courage. I feel driven to shine even brighter!",
    "91029": "Tama really likes the bell on my head. She says the jingling makes it easy to find me.",
    "91021": "If only I could fly like Santa, I could whoosh right into school every morni—ah! But without a chimney, how would I get in?",
    "91022": "This belt is great. I can eat as much as I want and it just stretches. I'm going to feast this lunchtime.",
    "91023": "Every night before I sleep, I fold this costume neatly and place it by my bed. I hope one day Santa will see it.",
    "91024": "I wish Santa could see the cherry blossoms in full bloom... I bet that would wash away all his holiday fatigue in an instant.",
    "91025": "Wait! If you make a humongous giant snowman in winter, then you could still have some snow left in the summer!",
    "91026": "It's about time I wrote my letter to Santa. Would you like to join me? Back home, I used to write them with my mom.",
    "91027": "It's a good season for stargazing... They're so bright, it's like you can still see them even after you look away... That's how I'd like to shine too.",
    "92015": "It's now or never for Oguri Cap! ...Just thought it'd sound cool.",
    "92016": "I won't lose to some reindeer!",
    "92017": "So many people are supporting me... I can't let them down!",
    "92018": "I can be faster... as fast as Santa dashing through the night sky!",
    "92020": "A fan gave me this costume, so it fits perfectly. Now to pay them back... with a worthy run!",
    "92021": "I've decided on my present for you, Trainer. It can only be one thing... victory. Not to mention, it comes with a shoulder massage too!",
    "92022": "Trainer, I'm thinking of going back to my hometown to race for the holidays. What are your plans?",
    "93004": "It's a miracle that we met... and I'm glad we did.",
    "93005": "This is a great present. Thanks.",
    "95007": "Everyone's dreams are what keep me going!",
    "95008": "I'll shine bright like a star—a miracle in the night!",
    "95010": "I'm Oguri Cap. Let's give our fans the best present we can!",
    "70016": "Like the star on a tree, I'll twinkle bright.",
    "70017": "You like this ornament? A fan gave me instructions on how to make it. I can give them to you if you like.",
    "71016": "Like the star on a tree, I'll twinkle bright.",
    "71017": "You like this ornament? A fan gave me instructions on how to make it. I can give them to you if you like.",
    "95009": "Tis the season... for making dreams come true!",
    "40003": "A shining star... for all!",
    "40004": "Yes... Just watch, I'll make their dreams come true! Hehe... <i>Chomp!</i>",
    "30006": "Sorry for the wait. Here, this is my present to you.",
    "30007": "That was... awesome! All right!",
    "70018": "Amazing.",
    "70019": "I'm gonna win for the folks back home!",
    "71018": "Amazing.",
    "71019": "I'm gonna win for the folks back home!",
    "400000": "Since we all get to spend the holidays together, I'll make sure we have fun, we're happy, and... um, it's fun!",
    "400006": "Snow is not bad if you know how to handle it. I won't let anything stop me from fulfilling everyone's wishes.",
    "400009": "My belly's full and I'm powered up. I've got to stay strong for everyone who's supporting me!",
    "400014": "Thanks for running with me. Now what should I eat, cake or ramen? I'll just have both!",
    "410000": "Here I go!",
    "410001": "All right!",
    "410004": "Hehe.",
    "410005": "Hehe.",
    "410006": "Darn it!",
    "410007": "Darn it!",
    "410008": "Darn it!",

    "91005": "These clothes have frills for no reason... Hey, can I just rip these ruffles off?",
    "91006": "What's important is whether or not I get to stand on the winner's stage. I have no interest in the performance itself.",
    "91007": "The hem on this was actually longer to begin with. I tore it off because it got in the way... What, see something funny?",
    "91008": "Everyone makes a big fuss when I win... But if it helps lure in strong opponents, I guess that works out just fine.",
    "91009": "Running late in the morning is disastrous. I especially can't deal with the noisy crowds in the cafeteria...",
    "91010": "Ama gave me a boxed lunch again. They taste good, but I could do without the cutesy character shapes...",
    "91011": "If you can't sleep, then just run until you've got nothing left. That'll generally make you pass out.",
    "91012": "It's getting warmer. Looks like I can wear short slee—actually, I'll go sleeveless.",
    "91013": "The heat always tires me out... Maybe I'll sink my teeth into some meat for an energy boost.",
    "91014": "Fallen leaves scattering into oblivion is kind of sad... But me—I'm not finished like them.",
    "91015": "A kotatsu heater? Sometimes I do give in to the temptation...",

    "92001": "Okay, show me how you get it done.",
    "92002": "Carelessness can be fatal. Stay focused.",
    "92003": "Everything I do is to build strength for battle. I don't have time to daydream.",
    "92011": "Half-hearted training won't help me perform when the time calls for it.",
    "92005": "Birds will fly so long as their wings remain unbroken. Ever higher, ever farther...",
    "92006": "The stronger I get, the harder it is to see the end... But all I can do now is push forward.",
    "92007": "The more power I have, the hungrier I get... Hurry up and train me already.",
    "93000": "I like this new look we both have in our eyes.",

    "20034": "I will run with utmost pride. Even if my condition is not at its peak, I must uphold the title of Emperor.",
    "20035": "I feel ill-prepared. However, I can't afford to give up on the race. I will do all that is in my power.",
    "20036": "I cannot believe I am this unsettled before a race. I must collect myself at once and see this race through to the end!",
    "20037": "My ill form is my own responsibility. I will make sure to do whatever it takes to right this wrong.",
    "20038": "Let us begin.",
    "20039": "Understood.",
    "20040": "You can count on me.",
    "20042": "Ngh...",
    "20043": "Oh no...",
    "20046": "Shall we go?",
    "20047": "How exciting.",
    "20049": "I feel I have come a little closer to achieving my aspirations.",
    "20050": "Thank you, Trainer.",
    "30000": "Next time, I shall claim my rightful place at the top.",
    "30001": "Yes, a passable result.",
    "30002": "I must strive for even higher heights.",
    "30003": "Let this result serve as a cautionary tale.",
    "60000": "Let us put on the most excellent of concerts.",
    "60001": "Everyone is counting on me. I will not disappoint them.",
    "70001": "You have embraced my dream and chosen to walk this path alongside me. I find that deeply gratifying and truly encouraging.",
    "90000": "Good morning, Trainer. Let us tackle training today wholeheartedly and with zealous effort.",
    "90001": "I aim for the zenith of Umamusume kind... And that means giving today my all as well.",
    "90002": "Is it afternoon already? Our time is finite, so let us train swiftly and decisively.",
    "90003": "I finished all my student council duties this morning. I can devote myself to training without constraint.",
    "90004": "The sun has completely dipped below the horizon, but that doesn't mean that the day is done just yet.",
    "90005": "Good evening, Trainer. Fatigue usually begins to catch up with me this late in the day, but I can hold out somewhat longer.",
    "90006": "This is the time of year that many students make their debut. I hope they all have great races.",
    "90007": "I treated Teio to some ice cream, and she seemed overjoyed. Hehe! I should make more time to dine with her.",
    "90008": "I never let fall pass without some moon gazing. A large moon shining brilliantly in the night sky may be the sort of existence I aspire to.",
    "90009": "The track gets covered in snow around this time of year. We in the student council must make sure proper maintenance is performed.",
    "91000": "Air Groove is always helping out in one way or another. It is no exaggeration to say that the school council can only function because of her support.",
    "91001": "Many students come to the student council with their worries. Hm... It seems the cafeteria ran out of food at lunch once again.",
    "91002": "Hehe, it seems we're \"plumb out of plums\"! Hehehe!",
    "91003": "Victory is at the forefront of my mind, but that's not all. I also wish to be mindful of the way in which I win.",
    "91004": "There are many unique students, but what they all share is a dedication to running. I hope each of them can achieve their goals... their dreams.",
    "91005": "Let there be no doubt. My winning concert shall be the zenith of performance as well. I shall give the fans a show to remember.",
    "91006": "My outfit is quite popular among the students. I must give a performance worthy of their admiration.",
    "91007": "My signature racewear imbues me with energy. I guess I could say that it switches me from president mode to Emperor mode.",
    "91008": "I shall brave the path towards the top in my signature racewear. It is an indispensable part of me.",
    "91009": "I feel motivated every time I see everyone's morning training sessions. That makes it even more vital to attend.",
    "91010": "Some Umamusume have voracious appetites. I must talk with the school administration and see if they can increase our food allotments.",
    "91011": "I shall go to bed tonight and lay awake in deep thought... as I think up new jokes.",
    "91012": "Most think of cherry blossoms when spring arrives, but a number of G1 races also take place in this season. I wonder what new Star Umamusume will emerge.",
    "91013": "I'm told I seem cool and collected even in summer. Hmm, I wonder if I should go around looking languid occasionally?",
    "91014": "Fall is filled with school events. Just imagining the students' smiling faces is enough to put me in high spirits. I will do everything I can to make them happy.",
    "91015": "The days are starting to get colder, but my passion is ever-burning. I shall never shrink from the cold.",
    "92000": "I am an Umamusume of her word. I will face any training with the utmost determination.",
    "92001": "Practice makes perfect, as they say. Let us get to training then.",
    "92002": "Training is always beneficial, be it basic or advanced. I will follow your lead.",
    "92003": "My preparations are complete. I'm ready for your instructions at any time.",
    "92011": "What shall we do today? I trust in your ability.",
    "92005": "If you are stuck, feel free to talk to me. We both share the same goal, after all.",
    "92006": "There's a part of me that always looks forward to training. Hehe, let's see what you have in store for me today.",
    "92007": "We are partners who share common aspirations. No matter the training, I have complete trust in you.",
    "93000": "I hope to continue proceeding towards the top with you by my side.",
    "93001": "The path we have walked together has been full of eye-opening experiences.",
    "95000": "This is also a gift borne from all my hard work and dedication.",
    "95001": "I've taken another step towards the zenith—the greatest of glory.",
    "95003": "Yes, I am Symboli Rudolf.",
    "95004": "As the Emperor, I must command dignity.",
    "1008": "Let us fasten our laces and give it our all!",
    "1041": "Time to go.",
    "1042": "I expect great things from you.",
    "1013": "Here we go, Teio.",
    "1000": "Let us be united in our efforts!",
    "1001": "Well done, everyone.",
    "1003": "What a worthy opponent... A contender for supremacy, even.",
    "1002": "Turn failure into success and move onward.",
    "1004": "We have seized glory!",
    "1007": "A new high score. This calls for celebration.",
    "1006": "What a worthy opponent... A contender for supremacy, even.",
    "1005": "Turn failure into success and move onward.",
    "120000": "I feel spurred on by an invisible force.",
    "140000": "I expect great things from you.",
    "140001": "All right.",
    "140002": "This is hard...",
    "140003": "I thank you from the bottom of my heart.",
    "140004": "A passable result.",
    "140005": "Turn failure into success and move onward.",
    "140006": "I thank you from the bottom of my heart.",
    "140007": "A passable result.",
    "140009": "Dear me...",
    "140011": "Resplendent!",
    "140014": "What?!",
    "140015": "Hm...",
    "140016": "Hey!",
    "140012": "All right!",
    "140013": "Oh!",
    "140017": "Hmmm...",
    "140018": "What happened?",
    "40000": "Let the heavens hear me roar!",
    "40001": "There is no path laid out before me. Which is why I shall carve one myself with spirit and vigor!",
    "30004": "As they say, \"Eclipse first, the rest nowhere.\"",
    "30005": "Behold... <i>That</i> was the run of an Emperor!",
    "31000": "Let us make history today.",
    "13": "This is today's login bonus.",
    "15": "Hmmm, for tomorrow... this, I suppose.",
    "110000": "Progress is born of consistent practice.",
    "110001": "Every Umamusume has a story to tell.",
    "110002": "Are we going to enter a race?",
    "10021": "Well then, it appears your Umamusume Archive has increased in level.",
    "20051": "Let us progress together.",
    "70000": "Let us aim for our dreams together.",
    "95005": "Perhaps now I can be of more help.",
    "95006": "My performance will be even better going forward.",
    "70004": "Even in uniform, I am ready to take to the track.",
    "70010": "A student council president should be a role model for all.",
    "70008": "Wearing this kind of outfit is refreshing in its own way.",
    "70014": "I shall sing and dance in a dignified manner everyone will enjoy.",
    "70009": "This signature racewear shall take me towards the zenith!",
    "70015": "Even after I reach the top, it will not be enough. I will always aim higher!",
    "71004": "Even in uniform, I am ready to take to the track.",
    "71010": "A student council president should be a role model for all.",
    "71008": "Wearing this kind of outfit is refreshing in its own way.",
    "71014": "I shall sing and dance in a dignified manner everyone will enjoy.",
    "71009": "This signature racewear shall take me towards the zenith!",
    "71015": "Even after I reach the top, it will not be enough. I will always aim higher!",
    "2030": "Let us be united in our efforts!",
    "2031": "Let us fasten our laces and give it our all!",
    "2032": "Thank you, Trainer.",
    "2033": "Hehe! My heart is bounding with anticipation. I'm sure my performance today will yield good results.",
    "2034": "Hehe. My jovial mood will surely prove beneficial to my performance today. I could take off any minute now.",
    "2035": "Thank you, Trainer.",
    "81000": "Let us foster each other's potential.",
    "81001": "The warm-up ends here. Let us take on the real challenge.",
    "70018": "My glorious reign has just begun.",
    "70019": "I'll show you what is absolute!",
    "71018": "My glorious reign has just begun.",
    "71019": "I'll show you what is absolute!",
    "90010": "Just like martial arts, racing begins and ends with respect... So Trainer, I would like to respectfully say that I look forward to today's training.",
    "90011": "While I was taking my morning walk, a kind woman said my clothes have a beautiful pattern. She even gifted me with a piece of mochi.",
    "90012": "We archers have a saying—\"True shooting, certain hitting.\" Let us keep this principle in mind as we go about our day.",
    "90013": "Now, the next event is scheduled for... Hm, I'll have to contact the coordinator before the day is done.",
    "90014": "They say the darkness draws in all manner of evil... Perhaps preparing a course of action is in order—just in case something happens.",
    "90015": "The more I plead with my body to slumber, the longer I lie awake... The night before the festival was especially rough for me.",
    "90016": "<i>Yawn...</i> Come spring, the base desire to sleep grows strong enough to resist the arrows of even the purest archers.",
    "90017": "A future where I can truly relax is still far off... But if we happen to have an opening in our schedules, we should go to a local festival.",
    "90018": "The chrysanthemum for the Kikuka Sho, the seasonal flowers for the Shuka Sho, and the shield of the Tenno Sho... No, that last one can wait until after I've been crowned at the end of the year. For now, let us simply enjoy this fall festival.",
    "90019": "Compared to outside, the temperature in here is just right. Be sure to stay warm, lest you catch your death... I suppose that goes for me as well.",
    "91016": "Teio was absolutely thrilled to see my hair tied up like this. We've even made plans to buy matching hair ties next week.",
    "91017": "The director was kind enough to push my selfish request all the way to the URA at the Fleetfoot Festival. She has my deepest respect.",
    "91018": "Change is constant... There will come a time where I, too, will decline and fall, like the autumn foliage. Before then, I must leave my mark.",
    "91019": "Curren Chan was teaching me the ways of social media, but I must admit it still... mystifies me.",
    "91020": "C.B. said I remind her of a fairy-tale hero, come to cleanse the world of evil. Personally, I think that role suits her better.",
    "91028": "My grandfather seems to enjoy this outfit. He even said I would be quite popular in France... Perhaps I should pay France a visit?",
    "91029": "Whenever I feel down, I just look at the fall foliage and remember that I have to <i>be-leaf</i> in myself. Hehe.",
    "91021": "Gold City gifted me this tail oil recently, and it smells just like lemons... It really adds some zest to my morning routine.",
    "91022": "The other day, I stopped by the archery dojo I used to attend as a child, and they gifted me with some jelly desserts. Would you care to sample them with me?",
    "91023": "Let me know when you're being plagued by nightmares. My arrows shall ring true and purify them for you.",
    "91024": "What sort of fruit shall be born of this season? I eagerly await the harvest.",
    "91025": "I've opened the windows to cool the student council office, but Brian insists that it's still too hot. I even gave her a fan. I swear, that girl...",
    "91026": "I see participating in the Fleetfoot Festival as a great honor. After all, our performance can prove pivotal to the rookies watching.",
    "91027": "A snow festival... If it's on a small scale, we should be able to recreate it on campus. I should reserve a truck to help transport any additional snow we need.",
    "92015": "My belt is secure. I'm ready to go.",
    "92016": "If I want to succeed from the onset, I must sharpen my intuition.",
    "92017": "They say music is great for raising morale... Tell me, which do you prefer? Taiko drums or the flute?",
    "92018": "No matter what they wear, an archer is still a hunter in essence. May my trophies convey my prowess.",
    "92020": "My target is in sight. All that remains is for me to be steadfast in my pursuit.",
    "92021": "If I deem a trial necessary for my conquest, not even the steepest slopes will keep me from advancing.",
    "92022": "Calling a racer a beast conjures a sense of fear, but also respect for their formative skills. Now, Trainer... what would you call <i>me?</i>",
    "93004": "Let us continue ever forward with calm and steady hearts.",
    "93005": "So this is what they mean when they say time flies.",
    "95007": "I look forward to using these sharpened fangs of mine.",
    "95008": "This flame... is it passion, or instinct?",
    "95010": "The name's Symboli Rudolf. Shall we?",
    "70016": "Now then, where is my next target?",
    "70017": "I must give a performance worthy of the chrysanthemums.",
    "71016": "Now then, where is my next target?",
    "71017": "I must give a performance worthy of the chrysanthemums.",
    "95009": "With my bow mighty and arrows pure, I shall expel all calamity.",
    "40003": "My bow and I shall ward off all disasters!",
    "40004": "The time has come—the targets are in sight. One... two... Now, take aim! ...It is done.",
    "30006": "With this, another target has been taken down.",
    "30007": "Remember well... <i>This</i> is how the Emperor runs!",
    "400003": "I have done all that I can to push them in the right direction. Now all that's left... is to watch and wait.",
    "400008": "The beast should open her eyes any minute now... This has been a long time coming, Brian.",
    "400009": "It took a lot of hard work to create such a memorable festival, but as they say, no pain, no gain... Now then, I must return to finish up my student council duties!",
    "410000": "Here I go!",
    "410001": "Good!",
    "410002": "Hm...",
    "410003": "Hm...",
    "410006": "Hahaha...",
    "410007": "Hahaha...",
    "410008": "Hahaha..."

    "10002": "You once called me the \"ideal empress.\" Rest assured, I will not allow that ideal to crumble.",
    "10003": "Happy New Year. Though it may be a time of celebration, you ought to refrain from overindulgence and live in an orderly fashion.",
    "10004": "<i>Sigh...</i> I am grateful that so many think highly of me, but this is entirely too much chocolate. Eating them all will be no easy task.",
    "10005": "I made some chocolates for you. I only wanted to acknowledge the work you do for me each day, but please tell me honestly how they taste. That is all.",
    "10006": "The bamboo trees are covered in wish slips for Tanabata. I can't help but hope that all the dreams written on them come true.",
    "10007": "Trick or treat. My mother told me to cherish these seasonal events. You enjoy yourself, too... In moderation, of course.",
    "10008": "When we decorate the big tree, there's always someone who tries to climb it... <i>Sigh...</i> I wonder who it'll be this year.",
    "10009": "The holiday decorations in town are worth seeing. If you're interested, then I suppose I could accompany you.",
    "10010": "Another year gone by... With you fussing about every day, there was never a boring moment. Yes, I'm being sarcastic. But you already knew that.",

    "10013": "I'll be heading home early today. My mother is coming to see me for my birthday!",
    "10014": "You want to celebrate my birthday? A-ahem... I am quite busy, but... Fine. Hold on, I'll free up some time.",
    "10015": "Hm? It seems there's some new information. Check it and report back immediately.",
    "10016": "Hey, a present came for you. Make sure you keep your packages sorted, you hear?",
    "10017": "Oh, it looks like you accomplished a mission. You better put what you learned to good use.",
    "10018": "It seems preparations are underway for an event. Make sure you confirm the details, lest you regret it.",

    "20004": "I feel great thanks to a peaceful day off. Now I can truly concentrate on training.",

    "20021": "Another race? Have you put any thought into this?",
    "20022": "This isn't a contest to see who can enter the most races. You <I>do</I> understand that, don't you?",
    "20023": "I have the most perfect form. Winning will come naturally.",

    "20030": "My form is as per usual. Now all that's left is to seize control of the flow of the race.",
    "20031": "I believe I can run as I always do... When I see an opportunity to claim victory, I shall take it.",
    "20032": "I can't say I'm in perfect shape, but... Hmph, that is exactly what makes this a worthy challenge.",
    "20033": "I must change my frame of mind... If I fail here, I fear I could never face my mother again.",
    "20034": "Even if my condition is lacking, I shall not falter. I must press on. That is what an empress does.",
    "20035": "My form is all wrong. This must be some kind of nightmare. But I will put a stop to it!",
    "20036": "Grrr... My form is pitiful. However, I will get my act together.",
    "20037": "Grrr... My condition is abysmal. Nevertheless, I need to retain my composure.",

    "30003": "How could this happen? Curses...",
    "60000": "I'll put on a performance befitting an empress.",

    "70001": "If I told my past self that you were to be my trainer, I would surely have been astonished. I still can't believe it now.",
    "90000": "Don't get sloppy just because it's morning. I won't tolerate any sleepiness.",
    "90001": "Morning. Have you decided on our schedule for today? I want you fully committed to your duties.",
    "90002": "Time marches ever onward. We need to hurry and finish what we can before the sun sets.",
    "90003": "Have you had lunch yet? Make sure to eat in moderation so as not to impede your duties this afternoon.",
    "90004": "Excellent work today. Resting is also one of your duties, so go home and sleep.",
    "90005": "The security guards are out on patrol at night, but you can't let your guard down. Be sure to always lock your door.",
    "90006": "So many bright eyes full of innocence and hope. As Empress, it is my job to lead them.",
    "90007": "Some get so caught up in running they forget to hydrate properly. I must make sure they receive thorough instruction on this.",
    "90008": "I don't usually like insects, but I think bell crickets sound positively beautiful. I hope they won't get trampled on among the fallen leaves.",

    "90005": "Maybe I'll have a cup of decaf tea before I go to bed… would you like to join me? I can tell your tea fortune♪",
    "90006": "The other day I found a park full of white clover. We could play coronation with flower crowns♪",
    "90007": "It's so hot every day! I've been to many countries, but this humidity is just feel like Japan!",
    "90008": "Japan has fewer clovers in the fall…? Hmmm…! The more precious it is, the more happy power it seems to have.",

    "90014": "Irish weddings are long. Everyone drinks and dances till the morning… it looks like a lot of fun!",
    "90015": "Time for the first dance? … Let's share the best moments. Will you take my hand, Darling?",
    "90016": "I went to see Sakura and it was beautiful…! The dancing sakura were like a flower shower.",
    "90017": "The other day, I did \"die-cutting\" at a food stall, and the store owner was very strict in her judging! I was so surprised! fufu♪",

    "91007": "I had a lot of my favorite clover motifs attached to this race outfit♪ Fufu, where is it?",
    "91008": "Fufufu… Uniform is good, this outfit is also good. Because the knees is out I feel lighter. It's a new sensation～♪",
    "91009": "When I ran early in the morning, the morning dew on the clover was sparkling, it reminded me of a castle garden♪",
    "91010": "Let's do our best in the afternoon practice. Whether or not it will be a wonderful memory depends on my ability!",
    "91011": "I have to try to go to bed as early as possible. If I stay up too late, the rotation of the guards will collapse!",
    "91012": "Lalala～♪\r Spring in this country is so sparkling and pleasant～♪ it's like a dream to have blue skies all day long!",

    "91018": "I'm thinking of throwing another dark hot pot party with Dober, would trainers like to join us as well?",
    "91019": "The other day I snuck off to Bright's dad's amusement park. I didn't know that amusement parks are usually so crowded!",

    "91025": "I heard that in Japan, when summer comes, that's when it starts. If i'm not wrong… \"Chilled Chinese noodles\"!",
    "91026": "It can get very cold in the fall back home. So I borrowed the captain's scarf once, you know?",
    "91027": "Hey, did you notice the little snowman by the window in the trainer's office after the snow the other day?",
    "91028": "She expressed my brilliance. She made me look so beautiful… I feel my spine grow taller when I feel your thoughts.",
    "91029": "The Celtic knot has the meaning of \"eternity\". You really can't beat Beauty-san.",

    "92005": "I'm getting stronger and stronger… I wonder what exciting things you will teach me next?",
    "92006": "Father has gave me permission to enter the race… Let's work hard together so that we can live up to that trust♪",
    "92007": "Making memories is not only about what you did, but also who you were with. I'm glad you become my trainer …",
    "92011": "Watermelon splitting sounds like a fun game! How about we do it after practice? I want to treat the guard to something cold as well♪",
    "92015": "You are to lead me, and this is your supreme command. … Ha-ha-ha! Did I surprise you?",
    "92016": "It would be fun to open a new door together, wouldn't it?",
    "92017": "Something that can't be worn as a race outfit [dress]. That's why I'll do my best today as well♪",

    "110001": "So many wonderful memories♪",
    "110002": "Oh, Will you escort me to the race?",
    "120000": "Wow…! I wonder if it's blessing of the Clover…!",
    "140000": "Horay horay! Trainer～～♪",

    "400010": "Solving the riddle was a lot of fun. I made a lot of good memories♪",

    "10002": "Hm, not a single comment... Oh, it's nothing. I only changed my hair oil. It's still far from silky smooth, though.",
    "10003": "Happy New Year. Shall we get right into it and discuss the future? Let's keep our spirits up in the new year.",
    "10004": "Valentine's Day is also a day to express one's gratitude. So I'd like to express my heartfelt thanks.",
    "10005": "Appearance, taste, and packaging—I handcrafted these chocolates with a calculated balance of each. I hope you like them.",

    "10011": "Today is your birthday, correct? I hope it's a great day, filled with new knowledge and learning.",
    "10012": "Happy Birthday, Trainer. Heh, it's strange... I'm celebrating you, yet I feel the most delighted from it.",
    "10013": "Thank you for your congratulations, Trainer. I'll keep trying hard to live up to your expectations.",
    "10014": "I see... Now I finally understand. The only present I wanted was a few words—\"happy birthday\" from you.",
    "10015": "It seems like there's a new notice. It might be something important, so I suggest you check it as soon as possible.",
    "10016": "You received a present. I see you're not one to be overlooked.",
    "10017": "Looks like you completed a mission. A well-deserved recognition for your efforts. I, too, feel proud.",

    "20000": "Hm? A slight tingling in the fingertips... It's a sign of ill health. Let's be careful going forward.",
    "20001": "Phew... Sorry, Trainer... It would be illogical to train with this fatigue. May I take a rest?",
    "20002": "Hmm... Guess I need to rework the equation. Of course, this will be a major upward revision. Hehe, you could almost say things are going too well.",
    "20003": "Hey, can I run now? It may be illogical to feel this way, but I think we'll have great results today!",
    "20004": "My mind is clear and my body is alert... I can assure you that I'm in great shape.",
    "20005": "At this moment, I'm more than capable of meeting your expectations. Now, tell me your plan.",
    "20006": "I tested myself with some light exercises, and I'm not feeling bad at all. We can start anytime.",
    "20007": "Which formula should we test today... The location I'll leave to you.",
    "20008": "Hmm... Let's wrap it up early today. It doesn't seem like continuing to push through fatigue will provide good results.",
    "20009": "...Oh, sorry. I was just stuck in thought.",
    "20010": "Phew... I'm not feeling well. Could I relieve this weariness by training... That would probably have the opposite effect.",
    "20011": "The next item on the agenda is... Ugh... It's no good. I can't think straight, nor come up with the right words.",
    "20021": "Hm? Another race? As I grow more fatigued, my odds of winning... No, never mind. I'll leave it up to you.",
    "20022": "A-another race?! I'm sure you have some kind of plan, but I would ask you to reconsider my schedule.",
    "20023": "Heh... The adjustments are perfect. Victory is as good as guaranteed. Prepare for good news, Trainer!",
    "20024": "Everything has been for this day... Now, all we have to do is prove to everyone that our theory is correct.",
    "20025": "I'm in good shape. Now, for the final touches. Give me a pep talk, Trainer. Those words will form the final piece to my victory!",
    "20026": "My form is approximately as expected. If that's the case, all that's left is to grasp victory in the actual race.",
    "20027": "My preparations are complete. And... good—you look poised as well. This is precisely why I can race with confidence.",
    "20028": "Now then... This is a crucial race. I swear by all the efforts I've made and the formulae I've written... I will win.",
    "20029": "We have finished based on the mean value. In other words, there is no problem even if our condition is average.",
    "20030": "I don't feel particularly good or bad... In that case, I suppose my ability to adapt will be put to the test once I'm in a race.",
    "20031": "We'll find out the truth in this race—whether our theory is correct or not.",
    "20032": "There shouldn't be a problem... Provided I can perform normally, of course.",
    "20033": "I wasn't able to make satisfactory adjustments, but everyone was given the same amount of time. All that's left... is to persevere!",
    "20034": "I still have some concerns about my adjustments... Let's keep in mind that the plan could change at the last moment.",
    "20035": "The tougher the problem, the better it feels once you finally solve it. That's why... I won't lose.",
    "20036": "...Are you nervous? You could certainly say that I'm in the worst possible shape. But I'll still give it everything I have. It's all I can do.",
    "20037": "I'm not asking for a miracle. I'll rework my theory while I run. I just want to win.",
    "20038": "Let's get started.",
    "20039": "Understood.",
    "20042": "What?!",
    "20046": "How exciting.",
    "20047": "Such nice weather.",

    "20050": "Thank you, Trainer.",
    "30000": "I could see a path to first place!",
    "30001": "Hmm, it was within expectations... But still...",
    "30002": "I need to adjust the formula.",
    "30003": "The solution I calculated came up wrong...",
    "60000": "It's okay. I'll do it just like in my lessons.",
    "60001": "Even in dance, I'll show you my own solution!",
    "70001": "The time when I met you and swore to complete my equation... You know, that may have been fate.",
    "90000": "For breakfast, I suggest a sandwich with a lot of vegetables. If you continue to vary the ingredients each day, you won't get sick of it.",
    "90001": "How efficiently you use your time in the morning has a significant impact on your overall results for the day. ...Does that sound too stringent?",
    "90002": "I'm tall so I tend to choose the back when we switch seats. ...It's not because of my hair!",
    "90003": "I often go to the library during my lunch break. I go to look for books, but it also feels nice to concentrate in a quiet environment.",
    "90004": "Are you feeling tired, Trainer? Ticket once said that she gets sleepy when talking to me...",
    "90005": "The pursuit of a theory continues around the clock. Let's do our best while being careful not to stay up too late.",
    "90006": "There are a lot of new students this time of year. I can easily tell by their innocent manner and expressions... Maybe I used to get carried away like them too.",
    "90007": "Phew... There's no way around it—heat builds up in my hair during summer. I have to take care of it, so it doesn't get damaged.",
    "90008": "Fall has many days with comfortable weather, so you can expect training efficiency to rise. Let's create a special training regimen.",
    "90009": "It's getting cold, Trainer. If you like, I can treat you to a special soup that will efficiently warm up your body.",
    "91000": "No matter how thick a book is, Taishin will always read it to the end. Even so, she sometimes gives off a rather... crude impression.",
    "91001": "The other day, Ticket asked me help to her study... No, it's fine. I'm sure she'll be able to avoid a failing mark. At least, theoretically.",
    "91002": "Recent TV crime dramas are excellent. The foreshadowing... The character dynamics... I always find myself watching one after a bath.",
    "91003": "I found a caterpillar in my room the other day. All puffed up with hair and wriggling around... Ugh, just thinking about it gives me the creeps!",
    "91004": "I had to listen to my mother complain that she hasn't heard from Brian. Goodness... It's difficult being an older sister.",
    "91005": "Race conditions are generally predictable, but there are too many uncertainties on a concert stage. I suppose that's why I'm nervous.",
    "91006": "Perhaps I'm not very good at singing and dancing. But as long as there are those who have hope in me, I'll do my best.",
    "91007": "How I look in a race is what remains in the memory of those who watch me. This design has plenty of impact, don't you think?",
    "91008": "This signature racewear is the embodiment of my determination. Someday, I will definitely complete my equation—and win it all.",
    "91009": "When my morning routine is disrupted, I feel restless for the remainder of the day. That's why I take the time to prepare.",
    "91010": "To make the most of your afternoon, you should eat only until your stomach is eighty percent full. ...Unless your favorite is on the menu.",
    "91011": "Do you fall asleep quickly when you go to bed? I've gotten into a habit of ruminating on things. Please tell me if you know a method of falling asleep quickly.",
    "91012": "I love spring and the way the flowers are in bloom. I've determined that if I see flowers while running, it results in improved performance.",
    "91013": "A nutritionally balanced diet is an effective way to prevent summer fatigue... but Brian is a picky eater.",
    "91014": "Fall evenings are good for reading. There's a wide range of genres, but I'll choose a few to recommend to you.",
    "91015": "A pinpoint exchange of attacks and evasive maneuvers! I was up against Ticket and Taishin, but snowball fights are quite fun!",
    "92000": "Logically and efficiently. That's the ideal when it comes to training. Let's do our best together, Trainer.",
    "92001": "Repetition is the key to both theory analysis and training. Let's keep up the effort.",
    "92002": "A hypothesis popped into my head just now. May I incorporate it into training and test it?",
    "92003": "Trainer, let me get a grasp of your instruction method. I'll then proceed with preparations accordingly.",
    "92011": "I want to practice at a good pace. If I speak in a roundabout way, please point it out.",
    "92005": "Consulting with you about my regimen is becoming something I look forward to every day. Hehe, thank you in advance for today as well.",
    "92006": "Hard work always pays off someday. I strongly believe that—just as you do, Trainer.",
    "92007": "I can devote myself to training with the help of someone like you who understands me. Please look forward to the day I repay your efforts with results.",
    "93000": "All the discussions we've had together are what sustain me.",
    "93001": "We've found a way to move forward.",
    "95000": "All right, let's move on to our next objective.",
    "95001": "The calculations paid off... Heh.",
    "95003": "I'm Biwa Hayahide. Nice to meet you.",
    "95004": "The results are indisputable—my victory takes shape as we speak!",
    "1008": "Let's do this according to plan.",
    "1053": "This reminds me of the old days.",
    "1040": "I've got it.",
    "1000": "Right! Let's do it!",
    "1001": "This is the result of working together.",
    "1003": "I guess we were an even match.",
    "1002": "Far better than I expected...",
    "1004": "Victory is ours!",
    "1007": "A new high score. We did it!",
    "1006": "I guess we were an even match.",
    "1005": "Far better than I expected...",
    "40000": "The solution I was looking for!",
    "40001": "I've verified and revised it again and again. This... is my very own equation!",
    "30004": "Heh... Well? Got a good look—rather closely I see!",
    "30005": "Hm... Just as expected. Good.",
    "31000": "All right, let's go.",
    "13": "Here's today's login bonus.",
    "15": "You'll get this tomorrow.",
    "110000": "We'll keep trying our best through repeated trial and error.",
    "110001": "The past records... Looks like they'll be useful in training.",
    "110002": "Are we going to race? If so, let's hold a strategy meeting.",
    "10021": "The Archive level has gone up. That's the result of constant effort.",
    "20051": "Let's train with efficiency.",
    "70000": "The winning equation... Let's find it together.",
    "95005": "Look forward to even better results.",
    "95006": "I'll teach you the optimal training method.",
    "120000": "Is this... the power of determination?",
    "140000": "Let's see what you've got.",
    "140001": "Well! A fine job!",
    "140002": "Agh!",
    "140003": "As expected, Trainer.",
    "140004": "You did it, Trainer.",
    "140005": "Mhm, the chance was fifty percent.",
    "140006": "As expected, Trainer.",

    "90107": "...Big Sister, it's hot... <i>Sigh...</i> I feel like I'm going to melt like porridge...",
    "90008": "Hehe, I picked up some beautiful fallen leaves. I wonder if Mother would be happy if I sent them in a letter?",

    "90019": "Vampires live in big castles, right? Winters must be so cold... I would never wander far from the fireplace if it were me.",
    "91016": "Guess what? Rob Roy and I were casting a magic spell in our room. Bubbles, bubbles, swirl and sway... Make tomorrow a good day!",
    "91017": "You know Bourbon? She made me a jack-o'-lantern, and she did it super fast! I couldn't believe it!",
    "91018": "Vampires can't eat garlic bread, right? Urgh... I'll just have to suck it up while I wear this costume.",

    "91021": "I had a really weird dream... I saw a vampire who was really, <i>really</i> hungry... Did I give them bad luck?",
    "91022": "People keep giving me candy, and all I'm doing is walking around campus... What am I going to do with all of this?",

    "20036": "I feel... tired, but the cause is unknown. However, some things can only be gained under these circumstances. <i>Sigh...</i>",
    "20037": "I'm in terrible condition! I just want to go home and sleep.",
    "20038": "Let us begin.",
    "20039": "By all means.",
    "20040": "Sounds interesting!",
    "20041": "Leave it to me.",
    "20042": "Hm?",
    "20043": "Oh?",
    "20046": "Shall we go?",
    "20047": "Not bad.",
    "20049": "Research is an everlasting endeavor, my dear guinea pig!",
    "20050": "Come, Trainer! Let us reverify it all!",
    "30000": "This result means... the experiment was a success!",
    "30001": "I've obtained some interesting data.",
    "30002": "Hm, a very interesting result.",
    "30003": "A little more research may be necessary.",
    "60000": "I hope we can both obtain something of value.",
    "60001": "I have a concert coming up, so don't miss it.",
    "70001": "I believed that you were just a mere guinea pig, but I seem to have underestimated you.",
    "90000": "Good morning, Trainer. Now, give me your arm. Let's start today with a blood test.",
    "90001": "<i>Yawn...</i> I made significant progress with my current research, and before I knew it, it was already morning... <i>Yaaawn...</i>",
    "90002": "I'm thinking of starting a new experiment this afternoon, but before that, would you mind going for a light ten-kilometer run?",
    "90003": "Have you finished lunch? I want to treat you to some tea. What? I assure you the flavor is normal. ...The flavor is, at least.",
    "90004": "If you can't sleep, I'll prepare a special medicine for you. Paying me back will be a nightmare, but hey! No worries!",
    "90005": "It's night, and I still can't detect any changes in your muscles, Trainer... Seems like the drug I gave you this morning was a failure. Ahh, what a shame!",
    "90006": "My heart is all aflutter seeing those fresh-faced Umamusume. I wonder if there are any good test subject candidates?",
    "90007": "There are a number of people I respect, but the person who invented air conditioning is the only one I want to send a thank-you letter to every year.",
    "90008": "Fall is the season of experiments... Heh-heh. ...Oh? Did I see you twitch just now? It could be convulsions. All right, time for an examination.",
    "90009": "I've prepared some cold medicine for you. Please take it as needed. If your body starts glowing, that means it's working.",
    "91000": "Even if I try to experiment on her in secret, Cafe always finds out... Hmmm... I wonder if she has some special ability.",
    "91001": "Tachyon means a \"faster-than-light particle,\" but the goal I'm aiming for lies far beyond that.",
    "91002": "I'm usually the observer, but when I'm with Digital, I experience what it feels like to be the one who's observed. It's quite novel.",
    "91003": "Nothing dampens my enthusiasm more than doping. What I seek is a lasting speed... My drugs are merely a tool to explore our potential.",
    "91004": "My family generally takes a hands-off approach to raising children. Thanks to that, I was able to immerse myself in research from a young age.",
    "91005": "I was thinking of installing a recording medium into my outfit, but I wonder if I can modify it so that it won't be noticed onstage.",
    "91006": "I try to observe the other Umamusume onstage while also dancing... Data collection is no easy task.",
    "91007": "This outfit raises my mood. With this, I'll be able to experiment during a race without issue... Heh-heh.",
    "91008": "An inquisitive mind never rests. It will not fade away, no matter the circumstances. This costume is a representation of that.",
    "91009": "I quite enjoy seeing you half asleep. No, don't read too much into it. It just means that I can experiment without trouble.",
    "91010": "Trainer, let me know in advance if you need to take a nap. I'll have many preparations to make, after all.",
    "91011": "If you're drinking coffee to rid yourself of drowsiness, then why not join me in an experiment instead? You will be more than wide-awake once I'm done.",
    "91012": "According to one theory, butterfly scales have the ability to reduce air resistance. ...Shall we try implanting some into your legs?",
    "91013": "Trainer, keep the room cool at all times, okay? The summer heat causes a significant decline in my cognitive functions.",
    "91014": "I've thought up a great way to spend a long fall night—wait, what are you so on edge for?",
    "91015": "To combat the cold, we must alter our thermoreceptors... No, for a fundamental solution—achoo! Ugh, I suppose turning on the heating would be faster.",
    "92000": "Now then, what should we do? How about we try twisting the microfilaments in your cells by three rotations?",
    "92001": "Accumulation and repetition are integral in both training and research! Now, let's immerse ourselves in a life of daily experimentation!",
    "92002": "Hm, I have something I want to try out in secret. Trainer, let's get started.",
    "92003": "We should investigate thoroughly. Curiosity may kill cats, but it's a price I'll pay to explore the realms of possibility.",
    "92011": "My preparations are in order. How about you? Care for an original Tachyon energy drink?",
    "92005": "Hmmm... Where should we begin today. Any thoughts, Trainer? I'll take your opinion into consideration.",
    "92006": "There's nothing trouble yourself over. There's something to be gained no matter the outcome, so hurry and decide.",
    "92007": "What kind of regimen have you come up with today, Trainer? Let's exchange ideas.",
    "93000": "Your presence has opened up many possibilities for me.",
    "93001": "Our destination is far off, but our potential is boundless.",
    "95000": "Heh-heh, this is getting interesting.",
    "95001": "<i>This</i> is our potential, Trainer!",
    "95003": "I'm Agnes Tachyon. Do you require my aid?",
    "1008": "Now, let's expand our potential!",
    "1069": "Let's get this experiment started.",
    "1026": "I'm in great shape. ♪",
    "1017": "Heh-heh, by all means.",
    "1045": "Please refrain from drooling...",
    "1057": "Afraid I can't hear you!",
    "1000": "Now then, let's start the experiment!",
    "1001": "A natural result.",
    "1003": "We still gained something from this.",
    "1002": "We need to reconsider our approach.",
    "1004": "Our potential has expanded again!",
    "1007": "A new record... This is an achievement.",
    "1006": "We still gained something from this.",
    "1005": "We need to reconsider our approach.",
    "120000": "Oh, how exhilarating!",
    "140000": "Allow me to observe.",
    "140001": "Excellent.",
    "140002": "Isn't the claw on this machine a bit weak?",
    "140003": "What a magnificent result!",
    "140004": "I'd say it's so-so.",
    "140005": "We need to reconsider our approach.",

    "140009": "Hehe!",
    "140010": "Hm...",
    "140011": "How tremendous!",
    "140014": "So close...",
    "140015": "Oh!",

    "13": "Looks like you got a login bonus!",
    "15": "You're getting this tomorrow.",
    "110000": "Great, let's start experimenting.",
    "110001": "It's also necessary to look back over past data.",
    "110002": "Oh, are you going to test the results of our research?",
    "10021": "Your Umamusume Archive level has increased. Is this the result of our research?",
    "20051": "Allow me to observe.",
    "70000": "If you want to realize your potential, then join me!",
    "95005": "Heh-heh... You can leave the support to me.",
    "95006": "We're one step closer to our full potential.",
    "70004": "A safe choice, but it's rather comfortable.",
    "70010": "I've ruined this uniform many times in my experiments...",
    "70008": "It seems easy to install things in these clothes, but will they be able to withstand strenuous movement?",
    "70014": "I suppose society considers this outfit cute, but I honestly don't get it.",
    "70009": "What do you think? This outfit really suits me, doesn't it?",

    "90002": "I finished my meal in 25 minutes and 30 seconds, and reviewed… oh no. I was supposed to meet Ms. Falcon for lunch.",
    "90003": "…every day for eight seconds. That's the time I use to check the cafeteria for new desserts.",
    "90004": "Four minutes to reconfirm plans, five minutes to think of family and friends… we make the most of the time we have before we go to bed and fall asleep.",
    "90005": "Today is ending… Let's reflect on the day, make plans for tomorrow, and prepare for the future.",
    "90006": "I have always admired spring flowers. The way they endure the harsh winters and bloom properly every year… it's magnificent.",

    "90016": "Cherry blossoms remind me of cherry blossom viewing with my parents… Actually, there are rows of cherry trees in Germany as well.",
    "90017": "It's been hot again this year… but don't worry. I made a cold cake, Kalter Hund.",
    "90018": "Recently, I have been searching for snacks that are as low in calories as possible. Even though it is autumn, I have to keep a tight control on my appetite.",
    "90019": "Basically, most sweets are made to cool down the heat, but if you eat them, your heart will be warmed… it's a strange thing, isn't it?",

    "90021": "Happy Valentine's Day",
    "90221": "Happy Valentine's Day",
    "91000": "I was humming along to the metronome when Ms. Falcon came up behind me… I was so surprised that I just screamed…",
    "91001": "I think Ms. Jordan may be a master at managing her schedule to keep up with that many friendships without strain.",
    "91002": "Your attitude toward competition is the opposite of mine, but I think that's why I have something to learn from you.",
    "91003": "Golsi and I toured a cake store, but before we knew it, it had turned into a candy-collecting tour.",
    "91004": "I like movies, but only zombies… It's strange that decomposing corpses can't move like that…!",
    "91005": "I want to make sure that every single step is perfect… I want to show respect to the audience and to the people I ran with.",
    "91006": "I have always loved carnivals. The thought of dancing in this costume makes my heart sing. Hmmm.",
    "91007": "Fluffy, yet sturdy enough to withstand strenuous activity… a great outfit.",
    "91008": "Perfectly sized to fit… I admire the skill of the master craftsman who made it.",
    "91009": "The smell of freshly made sweets wafting through the store before it opens sometimes makes me nostalgic for my parents' house.",
    "91010": "In Germany, lunch is the main thing. Even now, I haven't changed that habit. It is also reasonable for exercise.",
    "91011": "It would be nice to have an alarm that can be set to wake me up in seconds… but in the end, my body clock may be the best.",
    "91012": "It's the season to see ladybugs. They are so cute…",
    "91013": "It is indeed very hot… I would like to go to the lake, but let's cool off at the pool.",
    "91014": "Autumn is the season for sports, isn't it? Then I would like to play soccer. If you don't mind, I'd like to play with you.",
    "91015": "Snow reminds me of Stollen… I used to help make them every Christmas.",
    "91016": "Ms. Falcon, she can tell what candy I made by the smell of my clothes. It's kind of embarrassing…",
    "91017": "Whenever I make a new product, Bakushin O always shows up and tastes it. It's very helpful… but where in the world did she come from…?",
    "91018": "Lately I've been swapping homemade cakes with Ms. Flower. It tastes so tender… and so comforting.",
    "91019": "I believe that both racing and patissier work are equally challenging in terms of everything you have achieved.",
    "91020": "It is the pastry chef's job to color special occasions such as birthdays. Then I will… I will color the race with my running.",
    "91021": "The morning is the time to complete all the day's preparations… an ironclad rule for pastry chefs.",
    "91022": "Whether it's an after-dinner dessert or a snack… even if it's the same snack, we need to rearrange the timing and the content.",
    "91023": "Konditor… It could be said that a pastry chef's day begins at night. We have to prepare for tomorrow's event.",
    "91024": "In the season of cherry blossom viewing, it would be nice to make a stollen with the image of cherry blossoms instead of snow.",
    "91025": "Summer is the best time to travel in Germany. If we have the opportunity, we will show you around. Let us help you make your schedule.",
    "91026": "I would love to go out to pick chestnuts… I just came up with a recipe for a delicious looking Mont Blanc.",
    "91027": "Valentine's Day, Christmas… When the time comes for sweets to be served, we are all in a state of excitement.",
    "91028": "A craftsman is essentially a title given after rigorous training. I would like to keep in mind the importance of this costume.",
    "91029": "When I wear this outfit, I feel motivated to work on the piece… it's kind of like before a race.",
    "92000": "Let's work together to reach our goals. First, a plan.",
    "92001": "Schedule confirmed, okay. Let's get started today.",
    "92002": "We may be far away, but we have a steady schedule and we will get there.",
    "92003": "Of course we are already prepared. Thank you for your guidance.",
    "92005": "I truly believe that with you, we will reach our goal.",
    "92006": "Let's work together to finalize a plan. We are counting on you.",
    "92007": "If you think I'm being clumsy again, feel free to let me know.",
    "92011": "It's fresh… In Germany, lake bathing is more popular than sea bathing.",
    "92015": "Everything is ready. So, Öffnen… let's open the store.",
    "92016": "In racing, too, I will reach the level of a master… I promise.",
    "92017": "We will be precise in every step of the process, until we have completed our work of triumph.",
    "92018": "I see quite a bit of potential in protein cookies… both in taste and nutrition.",
    "92020": "For now, let's just focus on doing the best we can… and when we're done, we'll enjoy the sweet treats together.",
    "92021": "Preparation is essential so that the trainers can enjoy the taste of victory.",
    "92022": "We want to work together to produce the best results - just as my parents did in the kitchen.",
    "93000": "Now I can be truly proud of myself…",
    "93001": "I am sure I could not have made it this far on my own.",
    "93004": "The sweetest and happiest feeling ever…",
    "93005": "I hope I have become a worthy Meister.",
    "95000": "Steadily one step at a time… to the goal.",
    "95001": "We will walk forward to the person we should aim to be.",

    "110000": "All ready for training. I've already made room in my schedule.",
    "110001": "When you see how hard everyone else is working, it lights a fire under you, doesn't it?",
    "110002": "Right. If you want to race, this is the spot.",
    "10021": "Oh hey, your Umamusume Archive level went up. Why don't you go take a look?",
    "20051": "All right, let's do this.",

    "95005": "So? How do ya like my <i>management?</i>",
    "95006": "Is this what being a manager feels like? I kinda like it!",
    "120000": "I feel like I could run forever!",

    "140018": "Damn it...",
    "70004": "Hehe... Everyone still gets so surprised when I go on set dressed like this.",
    "70010": "Our disciplinary committee chair sure is scary when she catches you not wearing your uniform properly.",
    "70008": "Easy to run and dance in. Nice work, designers.",
    "70014": "The same outfit as everyone else. So this is the starting line?",
    "70009": "This outfit shows how serious the real me is... I'm fired up.",
    "70015": "I've made up my mind. I'm going to show my manager how I look gliding across the turf.",
    "71004": "Hehe... Everyone still gets so surprised when I go on set dressed like this.",

    "2030": "We've got this.",
    "2031": "Okay, let's do this.",
    "2032": "This is all thanks to you. I'm serious.",
    "2033": "I'm feeling pretty good. I know I put in the work, so... Yeah, I think I'm good to go.",
    "2034": "It'll be fine. I'll run with everything I've got! I want this to be a good race!",
    "2035": "This is all thanks to you. I'm serious.",
    "70018": "Damn, okay!",
    "70019": "I'll captivate you with my running!",
    "71018": "Damn, okay!",
    "71019": "I'll captivate you with my running!",
    "90010": "...Yeah, I'm awake. I mean, how could I still be sleepy after getting all dressed up like... this... <i>Yawn.</i> ...You saw nothing, okay?",
    "90011": "Dancing really cleared my head. A little workout always does the trick.",
    "90012": "The sash actually doesn't restrict you much when eating. If anything, it's being nervous about how clumsy your movements look that gets to you.",
    "90013": "Right around this time of day, the sunlight just hits... I should turn off my brain and take a walk sometime...",
    "90014": "It's like, at camp we were all having so much fun together, and... I mean, I'm not, like, sad about it or anything. I'm not. I'm really not!",
    "90015": "When you can't fall asleep, going to a shrine is low-key the move. They're so quiet at night, it's like... airing out your room, but for your body.",
    "90016": "Are you a food over flowers type person? But like, what if the flower is me? What then? ...You're supposed to laugh. Don't take it seriously.",
    "90017": "It's so hot... I should buy a folding fan. A purple one, with lace. Make it part of the look, you know?",
    "90018": "Summer and fall festivals have totally different vibes. Like, I'm not a fan of huge crowds, but when it cools down in the fall, it's kinda nice.",
    "90019": "Haha! Sorry, just remembered something funny. Yukino made a snow bunny, all white with these big round eyes... It was adorable.",
    "91016": "I'm going for a glossy look with my makeup. Red lip gloss and eyeliner, plus liquid foundation for that dewy glow.",
    "91017": "The Fleetfoot Festival gave me chills the first time I saw it. I felt like I just had to go running then and there. Ended up getting yelled at for breaking curfew. Good times.",
    "91018": "Is it just me, or does the council president... No, never mind. Sometimes I feel like she's trying to make a pun, but nah.",
    "91019": "Curren uploaded a pic of the Fleetfoot Festival with a really nice background and all. She's gifted on that side of the camera too, for real.",
    "91020": "Okay, so Jordan won't stop snapping pics of me. Like every time we meet it's just shutter sounds. Can you do something about her?",
    "91028": "Wearing this makes me stand a little taller. I just think about all the hopes and dreams entrusted to me.",
    "91029": "I'm basically used to it by now, but wow, putting on a kimono takes time. No lie, I fall asleep while standing there sometimes.",
    "91021": "I'm feeling Japanese food. It always hits the spot. Something on the hearty side for breakfast sounds nice, so maybe I'll have grilled fish.",
    "91022": "Oh, snap a pic for my Umasta. My manager's the one who runs the account, but she's always nagging me to stockpile content... <i>Sigh.</i>",
    "91023": "Did you notice I curled my hair a little? Whenever I get my hair done really nice, it always feels bad undoing it afterward.",
    "91024": "You think the way cherry blossoms dance as they fall would be a good reference? ...No, they're too light. I need something more dynamic...",
    "91025": "Ahh, the breeze feels so nice... Kimonos are actually pretty breathable, so they don't get as stuffy as they look. Try it out.",
    "91026": "There's a lot of G1 races in the fall, so I get why you'd want to pray to the gods. But in the end, it all comes down to yourself, doesn't it?",
    "91027": "Do I look like the cold doesn't bother me? I'm feeling it, trust me. But a swimsuit in winter is just another day on the job for me, so this is nothing.",
    "92015": "Just like dance, it's all in the core... Okay, I think I got it.",
    "92016": "<i>Se-no se!</i> ...I thought a little chant would help get us fired up. Whatever, let's just start!",
    "92017": "...Okay. My mind is all zen or whatever. Good to go.",
    "92018": "The only way to get better is by practicing. So let's work hardish today, yeah?",
    "92020": "I'm always doing work in traditional clothing, so I can run however you need me to.",
    "92021": "Can you check my form? Wouldn't want to be caught looking clumsy in this thing.",
    "92022": "Hey, you should do a little dance for a change of pace. ...Pfft, I'm kidding. But, hey, who am I to stop you?",
    "93004": "The festival might be over, but... our time together isn't.",
    "93005": "All our vivid memories... I'll never forget them.",
    "95007": "Do my colors pop?",
    "95008": "In full bloom!",
    "95010": "Gold City. See what happens when I dance.",
    "70016": "My sleeves and hem flutter in the wind when I twirl! ...Huh? I'm not getting carried away.",
    "70017": "Did you see my feet? I made sure not to slack on my toenails either. See how pretty the ombre is?",
    "71016": "My sleeves and hem flutter in the wind when I twirl! ...Huh? I'm not getting carried away.",
    "71017": "Did you see my feet? I made sure not to slack on my toenails either. See how pretty the ombre is?",
    "95009": "If I'm dancing, I'm gonna be the most stunning dancer onstage!",
    "40003": "Fall for me yet?",
    "40004": "Mm, perfect. Hey, between the dancing leaves and me... which is more vibrant?",
    "30006": "I didn't ride on the wind. I got here with my own two legs.",
    "30007": "Higher... I can go higher.",
    "400004": "I've gotta face this head-on. I'll be a loser forever if I don't do something.",
    "400010": "Well... I gave it my all. That I can say with my head held high."

    "20031": "Condition? I guess so-so. Now if I can just do it like the practice…",
    "20032": "Are we in the real thing already? I wanted to make more adjustments, but… what can I do?",
    "20033": "I can't back out now, I'll do whatever I have to do, even in this condition!",
    "20034": "I have regrets, but there's no point in dwelling on it. As long as we get results, that's all that matters, right?",
    "20035": "Even if the adjustments are terrible, I'm going to win. I don't want to make excuses.",
    "20036": "The result is not determinde by your condition. You won't know until the actual competition.",
    "20037": "My condition is in shambles, I don't care anymore. No matter what the situation, I have to win…!",

    "30000": "Ahhhh! Next time, I'll definitely take the first place…!",
    "30001": "We're not done yet… We're going to go higher…!",
    "30002": "Not bad… but half-assed strength doesn't mean anything.",
    "30003": "Damn…! This isn't how it's supposed to be…!",
    "30004": "Huh! Did you see my true strength!?",
    "30005": "Heh heh… That's what I'm talking about!",
    "30006": "Well, Did you see it… my tuning!",
    "30007": "Heh heh… That's what I'm talking about!",

    "40000": "I won't let anyone get in my way…!",
    "40001": "Faster, faster…! Faster than anyone else! Don't underestimate me, I won't let you laugh. I'll show you what I'm look like when i'm serious!",
    "40003": "To heights no one else can reach…!",
    "40004": "…I can't do it? Give up? Don't underestimate me! put them all together… and shake them off…!",
    "60000": "Live huh… even though I'm already sattisfied with just winning the race.",
    "60001": "Fuuu, haaa…… Okay! Let's do it…!",
    "70000": "…If you don't come, I'll leave you.",
    "70001": "You've been a hot headed ever since we met. Don't you get tired with that tension?",
    "70004": "I'm not a fan of tight-fitting clothes. Uniforms… still okay.",
    "70008": "It's strange that everyone wears the same clothes.… It feel like I'm going to be buried in big guys.",
    "70009": "My own personal clothes… what are you looking at? Don't laugh.",
    "70010": "I'll have to buy a new uniform when I grow up. …I'll kick you if you say I don't need one, okay?",
    "70014": "I don't like to show off, but… I'll do the Live show. It's proof that we won.",
    "70015": "Don't ask me to be cute, okay? This is my style.",
    "70016": "What? It needs maintenance?",
    "70017": "CM shooting… will there be another one?",
    "70018": "Hmm, hmm ……♪",
    "70019": "I won't lose.",
    "71004": "I'm not a fan of tight-fitting clothes. Uniforms… still okay.",

    "71019": "I won't lose.",
    "80000": "Good work.",
    "81000": "If you underestimate me just because I'm small, you'll regret it.",
    "81001": "I'm not done yet! I'm not going to lose to you.",
    "90000": "Haaa… I thought today would be the day I would be able to run on a course without other people. Too many early riser training idiots…",
    "90001": "…I wonder if we'll do the race, first thing in the morning. They say height is higher in the morning.",
    "90002": "How can they all eat so much for lunch? If I did, I won't be able to move.",
    "90003": "Huh… I think I'll take a nap. I wonder If there is place where Ticket won't find me… In the first place, how did she always find me?",
    "90004": "I'm not going home yet. I haven't reached my quota for today. I need to train more…!",
    "90005": "I heard that if I don't sleep, I won't grow taller, but I still have training to do… Ahhhh, there's just not enough time.",
    "90006": "It's getting warmer, maybe I'll take a nap on the rooftop…",
    "90007": "Ahhhh mou, Even though it's already hot, but Tickets are so noisy that it makes it even hotter…",
    "90008": "…It's been a while since I've done a fallen leaf bonfire. I like the flickering flames and the sound of wood burning… I quite like it.",
    "90009": "In winter, I think it's best to relax and have a one-person hot pot. It's warm and easy to clean up afterwards. … What, I won't call you, okay?",
    "90010": "…You have sleepy face. You're too lax. Want me to re-tighten the screws in your head?",
    "90011": "Haaah… I'm sleepy… I play too much because of the triple EXP. My level is getting higher and higher, so I don't know when to stop…",
    "90012": "VR Umarator, queue again… And reservations are full… I wonder if they will add more…",
    "90013": "That cloud… it looks like an airship or something will pop up. And save the world by riding on it… It's so cliché it feel lame.",
    "90014": "The workshop in the game smells like oil… but it's a strange smell that I can't get sick of.",
    "90015": "That enemy doesn't attack at all! You're doing great… developers. Damn… one more battle before I go to bed…!",
    "90016": "It's against the law to have caterpillars fall down! You made make a funny noise…! Let's not play games there…",
    "90017": "It's hot, but not too hot, because the VR workshop is scorching hot, like a sauna…",
    "90018": "I didn't know steam locomotives were still running. If you are in the area on an expedition or something, you might want to go see it…",
    "90019": "The battery on my phone is running down fast. It's like this when it's cold. Am I using it too much? No, but…",
    "90020": "…… Happy Valentine's Day!",
    "90021": "…… Happy Valentine's Day!",
    "91000": "Ticket shook me up and say, \"Taishintesto!\" I'm not a building.",
    "91001": "People are surprised when they look at my rank in mobile game…… I mean, It's normal if you've been playing for a long time, right?",
    "91002": "I was listening to the radio, and they were playing a song that I had requested. …Well, that's all.",
    "91003": "I can't wait to be able to do all my shopping by mail order… I hate crowds and I don't have to talk to store clerks…",
    "91004": "When I was removing stains from my clothes, Creek-san started praising me a lot… I just want to take care of my own things.",
    "91005": "Winning live, you know… who would have thought of making the winner of a race sing and dance, seriously.",
    "91006": "Haaaa, If we are using matching outfit the height difference is… ………nothing, forget it.",
    "91007": "I like the hood. It takes away the annoying stares and lets me concentrate on the race… and when I get to the finish line and take it off, I see a different scenery.",
    "91008": "Well, I noticed that I have a lot of asymmetrical clothes… …I think it's just a coincidence.",
    "91009": "I forgot my lunch box at the dormitory ……it's such a pain to go back… But the cafeteria has been crowded lately with all the sweets fairs and stuff… haaa.",
    "91010": "I went to the library during lunch break and Hayahide recommended a very thick book, saying it was a great book… I ran away.",
    "91011": "Oh, the event of that game ends today… well whatever. I'm just playing it to kill time…",
    "91012": "You should at least do a proper orientation for new students… Why do I have to be the one to guide them…?",
    "91013": "I'm thinking of going to some empty beach… I want to see sea anemones and stuff…",
    "91014": "A rare bird I saw in the park… I wonder if it was a migratory bird…? It's nice to be able to fly so far away.",
    "91015": "This school is so noisy in the winter with all the events… haah. I wonder if it will be quiet If it snows a lot … I guess not.",
    "91016": "Like putting on a button or inspecting horseshoes, etc… Does Ticket even know what an engineer's role is?",
    "91017": "Hayahide invited me to play a competitive puzzle game, and it looks like reaction time is the key. Well, I'm not just quietly accepting my lose.",
    "91018": "Teio's movement in VR was strange. Does it mean that the spring can't be reproduced in the game? Is she a real strong character?",
    "91019": "I bumped into Turbo earlier. We both got hit on the forehead. I really thought I was taller.",
    "91020": "I want to stare blankly at gears… The regular movement and rhythm… I feel like I can watch it all the time…",
    "91021": "This morning… I feel like I've wandered into a different world than usual… I've been playing too many games…",
    "91022": "Ah, Hayahide's scolding was long. I just played a game during dinner. Next time, I will try to make sure she doesn't find out.",
    "91023": "Oh no… I almost forgot about the app log-in. If I miss this, I'll be late for the equipment enhancement…",
    "91024": "It's getting nice and warm… Sometimes I go to the park for a walk … and play games.",
    "91025": "All the game commercials are full of swimsuits. What is it… I hate myself for feeling summer with this.",
    "91026": "I remember a game resident I played in VR steamed a baked potato with steam. Hmmm… weird world.",
    "91027": "It's cold. Let's start up Umarator… It's too convenient to warm up in the game. You can play and kill two birds with one stone.",
    "91028": "…hmm, what? What did you say? I have earphones in my ear covers, so it's hard for me to hear you.",
    "91029": "I have good eyesight, so I don't wear a monocle. I don't play games in the dark. That's how much care I take.",
    "92000": "I'm going to go as usual today.",
    "92001": "Whatever you do, don't cut corners.",
    "92002": "My preparation is complete. What are we going to do?",
    "92003": "We need to get to the bottom of this and catch up…!",
    "92005": "Well… you're my trainer. I'll follow your instructions.",
    "92006": "Don't worry too much.",
    "92007": "Your teaching style is… okay, I guess. It's Hot and annoying, though!",
    "92011": "Come on, let's do it quickly. It's a waste of time.",
    "92015": "First, we will break in. Then gradually increase the pace.",
    "92016": "Just give me a score based on your criteria. That's more exciting.",
    "92017": "I'll do it quickly. I'm already warmed up.",
    "92018": "Don't say something ikewarm like trial and error. I'm going to give it my all right from the start…!",
    "92020": "I don't mind if we work together. But if you drag me down, I won't accept it.",
    "92021": "You don't get involved too much, do you? You know your role.",
    "92022": "You're a [buffer] aren't you?… Backup, don't screw it up okay.",
    "93000": "Parter up with you… well, I guess it's fine.",
    "93001": "Yes. I think we got the result, didn't we?",
    "93004": "Thanks for the support… it wasn't bad.",
    "93005": "Not quite there yet. Next time we will go higher.",
    "95000": "Not ye… I still need to refine my sharpness…!",
    "95001": "No matter what obstacle, I will tear it down!",
    "95003": "Narita Taishin. I will kick you if you look down on me.",
    "95004": "Everyone keep making fun of me! I will run, and I will show them I can win!",
    "95005": "I'm troubled if you get your hopes up…",
    "95006": "I'll do it …Somewhat.",
    "95007": "Level up… not like this.",
    "95008": "Increased output… Go for it!",
    "95009": "Even if it breaks into pieces… I'll fix it again and again!",
    "95010": "Narita Taishin. Are you my assistant? Oh, well.",
    "110000": "What, are we going to train?",
    "110001": "History… not really interested.",
    "110002": "Are you entering the race? …I see.",
    "120000": "My body is hot… what is this feeling?",
    "140000": "You're going to do it? …Oh, yeah.",
    "140001": "Heh…",
    "140002": "Uh…",
    "140003": "Surprising. You are good at this kind of thing.",

    "400002": "It's so cold… I'm glad I didn't listen to Ticket. Building a tent on a frozen lake, she is too stupid…",
    "400005": "Huh… I talked too much. I'm tired… … Maybe it's a talent, in a way, to be so loud all the time…",
    "400006": "The machine repair operation screen is a puzzle game. …I've been doing it a lot, so I'm getting by.",

    "10013": "I can't believe everyone is celebrating my birthday! <i>Sniff...</i> I'm so happy that my fortune is pouring out of my eyes!",
    "10014": "Your fortune today says that you will have good luck if you are with someone celebrating their birthday! So... wanna spend the day together?!",
    "10015": "Hmm... My divination tells me that there's a notice for you! Let's check it!",
    "10016": "A present has arrived for you! Perhaps it's a lucky item?",
    "10017": "Great work completing a mission! Look like our luck is improving! Let's keep pushing forward with this momentum!",
    "10018": "Looks like there's an event coming up! Shall I attempt a divination to predict what it will be?",
    "10019": "An event has started! My divinations say that participating will bring good luck! Wanna check it out?",
    "20000": "Urgh... No energy... It seems I was overconfident in my own strength.",
    "20001": "My divinations say that resting will bring good luck today, so how about it? I'm also just a little tired...",

    "20003": "Listen to this! My fortune today goes even beyond <i>great.</i> Heh-heh-heh, I'm invincible now!",

    "20005": "My chopsticks split cleanly, so I feel great today!",
    "20006": "Today's fortune is neither good nor bad. Normal is the best though, so let's do it like we usually do!",
    "20007": "Oh, great Shiraoki, please grant me your blessings today!",
    "20008": "I drew a fortune slip that had misfortune written on it... I'm so worried about it that I can't concentrate on my training...",
    "20009": "Everything has felt so unlucky today... Maybe my good fortune's running out... Ughhh...",
    "20010": "My divination gave the worst result... My fortune slip said great misfortune... And to top it all off, even a black cat crossed my path! I-It's all over for me!",
    "20011": "Ugh... My body feels so heavy... It seems that my spiritual power is lacking... Gah.",
    "20021": "I keep entering races, but is this really okay? My fortune says that my luck will drop if I keep doing the same thing over and over...",
    "20022": "How about we pass on this race? I've been running non-stop recently... Also, my luck is at rock bottom...",
    "20023": "Excellent fortune! Great luck! No one can stand in our way! I feel like I can win any race right now!",
    "20024": "I had a dream that I was running alongside the great Shiraoki! Such an auspicious dream... Victory's pretty much a done deal, right?!",
    "20025": "A-amazing! No matter what fortune I check, they only say good things! I don't feel like I can lose at all!",
    "20026": "My fortune for racing is good! Looks like I'll be able to give it my all!",
    "20027": "I've fully recharged my spiritual power! It's all thanks to the sacred sites I visited!",
    "20028": "I received a certain-victory charm from my family's shrine! I can win for sure with this!",
    "20029": "Shifting gears to a lucky dash! The prize I'm chasing? Great fortune!",
    "20030": "I did two divinations today, but the results were complete opposites! That means it all depends on my effort!",
    "20031": "Looks like I'm not in bad shape! All I have to do now is run while having faith in my trainer and the great Shiraoki!",
    "20032": "I drew misfortune, but my lucky person is someone close to me who I can rely on... In other words, I just have to believe in you, Trainer!",
    "20033": "I ate some pork cutlets, so I should be able to hang in there... I'm not in great shape though...",
    "20034": "Today's fortune says that happiness may lie ahead after overcoming difficulties... I'll try as hard as I can!",
    "20035": "It's okay! ...I'm sure the great Shiraoki is watching over me... Regardless, I'm going to run with everything I have!",
    "20036": "Whaaat?! I can't find my certain-victory charm! W-well, I guess all I can do is believe in myself and do my best...",
    "20037": "<i>Sigh...</i> I drew great misfortune... I'll just have to run with everything I've got and try to carve a path to victory...",
    "20039": "I'll do my best!",

    "30000": "So close! Next time I'll grab first place and great fortune!",
    "30001": "I was just a little bit unlucky!",
    "30002": "I'm sure there will be good luck coming my way soon! I'll do my best next time!",
    "30003": "I could really use some good fortune right about now...",
    "60000": "Now, it's time to share my good fortune with others!",
    "60001": "Let's perform a dance of gratitude!",
    "70001": "Meeting you opened up a path for me to move forward... I'm ever grateful to both you and the great Shiraoki!",
    "90000": "Good morning and good fortune! You get a free divination today!",
    "90001": "My heart feels clear and refreshed! Could it be because I polished my crystal ball first thing this morning?",
    "90002": "Let's head to the shrine right after lunch. I want to raise my training ability for today!",
    "90003": "Fancy having lunch with me? I'll also tell you today's lucky food!",
    "90004": "I recommend placing three hard candies under your pillow. I feel like it might improve your luck just a little bit!",
    "90005": "I-I can't really handle spicy food, but it seems like eating it now will be good feng shui... The pain will be for an honorable cause!",
    "90006": "I recommend a large wrapping cloth instead of a blue tarp when setting up for cherry blossom viewing. An arabesque pattern will even increase your financial luck!",
    "90007": "Gotta mention chilled noodles, somen, and cold tofu... Okay, I've completed an incantation that will help us come upon delicious summer food!",
    "90008": "Haiya... Woiya... Revealed it has been! The lucky flower for this fall is the chrysanthemum!",
    "90009": "My fortune said staying warm would bring luck, so let's get cozy under the kotatsu! I-it's true, you know! I'm not lying!",
    "91000": "You can leave exorcisms and protection against misfortune to me! My family does run a shrine, you know. All my techniques are self-taught, though...",
    "91001": "Suzuka was looking pretty lonely earlier, so I gave her a large sea bream ornament! It's a good luck charm!",
    "91002": "I want to tell Taiki that she's going to have great fortune today, but how can I communicate it best? \"Today will be rootin'-tootin' great\"?",
    "91003": "Trainer, your fortune today is... sunny but partly cloudy! With some sudden downpours of great luck!",
    "91004": "Air Groove told me I was working really hard! I was so moved that I gave her a ceramic tanuki figure in thanks!",
    "91005": "Sometimes I fall over when helping out my family with Kagura dances. I'll have to be careful during the concert! I hope nobody gets hurt!",
    "91006": "I'm used to wearing flowing clothes, such as traditional miko garb! I often accidentally step on the hem though...",
    "91007": "This racewear seems like it will grant me good fortune. ...It's overflowing with spiritual power! If I wear this, I'm sure I'll win!",
    "91008": "Hehe! I have Miss Nya alongside me to bring me luck, so all I need to do is run with faith!",
    "91009": "Oooh, a divine message from the great Shiraoki! Let's see here... I have to eat any bits of eggshell I find in my rolled omelet?!",
    "91010": "Trainer, listen to this! Earlier, three whole tea stalks were standing up in my tea, but then... they all sank...",
    "91011": "Mwahaha, I'm making good progress on my homework! ♪ I have a reliable ally in my lucky pencil!",
    "91012": "The symbol of good fortune that awakens in the spring is... Yes, the ladybug! Come on, let's go looking for some!",
    "91013": "It's the season for delicious cherries. You can enjoy eating them and even use the seeds for divinations... They truly are the food of happiness!",
    "91014": "I recommend going on a pilgrimage in fall! You can also enjoy the fallen leaves and gourmet food. Now that's what I call efficiency!",
    "91015": "My skin is so prone to drying out... I know gold dust is lucky, but do you think it also has moisturizing properties?",
    "92000": "Preparations: complete. Fortunes: divined. Now, let's start today's training!",
    "92001": "Shall I divine the best locations for training?",
    "92002": "Hmhm... Spiritual power is gathering all throughout my body!",
    "92003": "Revvin' up a lucky dash to go chasing after some good fortune!",
    "92011": "Feel free to bring on the tough workouts! I've prepared a charm that keeps my muscles from getting sore no matter how much I run!",

    "92006": "I know I may rely a little too much on fortune-telling and divinations, but thanks for always standing by me. I'll do my best to meet your expectations!",
    "92007": "I have faith in both my divinations and you, Trainer! After all, I know that you are <i>the One!</i>",

    "20010": "I'm sorry for all my screw-ups… I'm sorry I was born…",
    "20011": "Aaahhh… I'm still a no-good, goofy, irredeemable, u-ma-girl…",
    "20021": "Huff… uh, are you going to the race? So, you are going to enter the race, right? A bad boy has to work hard…",
    "20022": "I'm sorry, I'm sorry…! I have to run… I have to race… but I can't move…",
    "20023": "Condition is perfect…! A lot!",
    "20024": "Ha-ha-ha-ha!……… your spirit today is on par with that of Ms. Opera O!",
    "20025": "Now that I've prepared properly, I feel like I can exert more energy than usual.",
    "20026": "Maybe it's just my imagination, but I think I'm feeling a little better. …Just a little bit.",
    "20027": "For me, I think I might have done decently -……",
    "20028": "At this rate… if I'm careful, it might not end badly…?",
    "20029": "Ha, hahi! It's a race…! I'll be careful not to fail～!",
    "20030": "I thought I could do my best normally. …as long as I don't get my clothes caught in the gate…",
    "20031": "Soooo～ hah～… Stay calm… stay calm…!",
    "20032": "At this rate… No, it's nothing…! I just have to do it…",
    "20033": "This condition… I might be a little bit worried…",
    "20034": "I'm sorry… I'm not feeling well～… Oh, but I'll do my best…!",
    "20035": "How are you doing? Perfectly fine… I'm not good at all～… But I'll try somehow…!",
    "20036": "I'm in a terrible state, but miracles may happen… I'll keep on running…!",
    "20037": "Even if you're in a slump… if you don't give up and keep running, there might be a way to save your life… right?",
    "20038": "All right…!",
    "20039": "Can you do it…?",
    "20040": "Calm down…!",
    "20041": "Even study…!",
    "20042": "Heehee～!",
    "20043": "Oh, that～?",
    "20046": "I'll be following you!",
    "20047": "I'm excited!",
    "20049": "Fwen… thank you… for your help!",
    "20050": "I hope I didn't cause you any trouble…?",
    "20051": "I'll try not to drag my feet…!",
    "23015": "Can you do it…?",
    "30000": "Oh, one more thing… No, nothing…!",
    "30001": "Third place……a little better…?",
    "30002": "Well, I managed to get in……………………",
    "30003": "Whew… sorry…",
    "30004": "I… hyaaaaaaaaa!? I did it!",
    "30005": "We could have won… yup!",
    "30006": "Let's go to the victory banquet together…! Let me show you around!",
    "30007": "We could have won… yup!",
    "31000": "Yes, I'm coming!",
    "40000": "Someday, even I… okay…!",
    "40001": "Yo～! Huh? Huh! Hee～! Nn～? Huh～… Ah……… Yo～shi～!",
    "40003": "Wow, I'm not good!",
    "40004": "Yes, this way please… Here, here, don't come～! Oh… what?",
    "60000": "It's starting!",
    "60001": "I will sing as much as I can!",
    "70000": "If it's okay with me…!",
    "70001": "The trainer's words… I will keep them as my good luck charm from now on.",
    "70004": "It's still a dream come true! I can't believe I'm wearing the uniform of Tracen Academy…",
    "70008": "Wearing a fluffy costume makes me feel fluffy too!",
    "70009": "What do you think…? Have you been dressed in your best clothes?",
    "70010": "This is my 5th ribbon… I often snag or tear them…",
    "70014": "Ugh… I'd better not fall down at the concert and get my costume dirty…!",
    "70015": "In my bag are plasters and bandages. Now you are ready even if you mess up!",
    "70016": "I feel relieved when I look at the lantern lights.",
    "70017": "Candy tucked into sleeves, they're all falling out!",
    "70018": "Thank you……!",
    "70019": "I'm going to win.…… I'm going to win……!",

    "80000": "Oh, thank you for your help.",
    "81000": "It's a game…! ………Hey, I said it…",
    "81001": "Ahhh… I can still do it…! I can still do my best…!",
    "90000": "Good morning. I'm sorry, do I have a sleeping habit…? It's not shaggy…?",
    "90001": "Opera O and Urara, you are always so energetic in the morning! I should learn from them too…!",
    "90002": "Have you eaten lunch? I… had to buy some more bread later because a bird took it away…",
    "90003": "I'm always sleepy after lunch… I have to make sure I don't join the next class like before…",
    "90004": "I feel at ease at night… I feel as if people will forgive me if I get depressed or depressed.",
    "90005": "Thank you for your hard work today! Tomorrow, I will do my best not to cause you any trouble…!",
    "90007": "I don't like summer… because it's too hot, but I like sunflowers and sparkling sunlight… I think I like those things…",
    "90008": "In a class assignment, we were asked, \"What's your favorite autumn season?\" but is there an appropriate autumn for me?",
    "90009": "I'm not afraid of the cold in winter. I used to live in the north when I was a child, and I have gloves and other gloves.",
    "90010": "Good morning! Let me show you around… Isn't today the day of the Haunted House?",
    "90011": "My stockings have holes…! I changed my stockings after Ms. Shakur taught me how to do it.",
    "90012": "Haunted houses are dark and scary… …Oh, if it was light at noon, would you be able to enjoy it even if you are scared?",
    "90013": "I'm sorry. The pumpkin pie I made for you all…………………………………left nothing but charcoal～～.",
    "90014": "It is very dark, so please be careful where you step. I fall down even if there are lights…",
    "90015": "Hyah! Trainer! Then the reason you ignored me when I tried to talk to you earlier… You've got the wrong person!",
    "90016": "The spring wind is scary, isn't it? My hat was blown off and I chased after it, only to get lost… I'm so sick of it!",
    "90017": "I dropped the huge pumpkin I harvested and cut it in half… I'll spend the rest of my life trying to save it～!",
    "90018": "What am I supposed to do as a prank…! Ugh… I'm dizzy from the pressure…!",
    "90019": "When I leave my hat outside on a cold day, a raccoon dog comes to hide in it. When I noticed her, she was breathing in her sleep… heh heh.",
    "90020": "Ha, Happy Valentine's Day!",
    "90021": "Ha, Happy Valentine's Day!",
    "91000": "When you are depressed, don't you feel like hiding behind something? Behind a building, behind someone…",
    "91001": "My parents are very kind. They said, \"Dotou is a great kid\"…even though that's not true at all…",
    "91002": "I am the King of the End of the Century! Ha-ha-ha-ha! Did I look like ………?",
    "91003": "I also have a relationship like that between Ms. Operao and Ms. Ayabe… No, I'm too afraid…!",
    "91004": "Aww… Ms. Taikishattle invited me to a party, but I think I'm out of place…?",
    "91005": "I don't like to wear clothes with many buttons. Because of my clumsy nature, I often misplace buttons…",
    "91006": "Aren't you nervous when you sing a fast-paced song? I'm afraid I'll chew…",
    "91007": "With this bag, I would be 100 times braver～. And strength… I hope it has that much.",
    "91008": "I love the bag and the ribbon on my chest, they are so cute! I feel like I will be cheered up when I wear it.",
    "91009": "Ugh, I thought my bag was heavy… but it wasn't my textbooks, it was my alarm clock!",
    "91010": "The carrot bread at the store… I'm a little curious about it, but I'm not sure I can make it if the first one to buy it wins…",
    "91011": "The streets at night are full of danger… I was so exhausted just going back to my dormitory…",
    "91012": "Cherry blossoms are dangerous… When I was walking around admiring the cherry blossoms, I hit a pillar and got a bump…",
    "91013": "The sea is dangerous… You may get your finger caught in a crab's mouth, or your float may be swept away……",
    "91014": "Yaki-imo is dangerous! If you don't let it cool down well, you'll burn your tongue like I did… hah…",
    "91015": "Snow is… beautiful but dangerous. I often slip and fall down hills… and become a snowman…",
    "91016": "I couldn't eat the candy, but I kept looking at it… and I could see my father's face in the jewelry store.",
    "91017": "Ms. Digital, you must be exhausted, falling down and getting up several times a day. Would it be a nuisance if I offered you something?",
    "91018": "Windy won't bite me. She says I'm crying too much and it's not good for me… I'm a little sad.",
    "91019": "Wheeeeee…! Whee～! So, is it done? Helios taught me how to do this Parisian thing…!",
    "91020": "Palmer-san, you made my enka songs so much fun… ehehe… Karaoke… I hope we can go again…",
    "91021": "My morning horoscope showed that pumpkin was my lucky item… hehehe…! Maybe something good will happen…!",
    "91022": "We bring snacks and sweets to the snack time with Ullala. I wonder what I should bring today…",
    "91023": "Recently, a cat comes to visit me at night. I wonder if they are interested in these clothes?",
    "91024": "Ugh… I'm a bad senior! I gently called out to a lost freshman and startled her to tears～!",
    "91025": "Do you have any water? I fell asleep with a pumpkin on my head and I'm sweating…!",
    "91026": "I… I definitely shouldn't be doing this. And yet you all look at me and say, \"I'm starving…\"!",
    "91027": "Yo, come this way if you like… The lantern is warm. How is it… is it helpful?",
    "91028": "When I wear a pumpkin, I feel like a different person. A little stronger, a little bigger…",
    "91029": "Why do crows always try to get me when I go outside? So many pumpkin crumbs!",
    "92000": "Please practice again today…!",
    "92001": "Which training would you like…? I can't decide… I would be happy if you could choose one.",
    "92002": "Sorry for the delay…! We've managed to finish preparations…!",
    "92003": "I'll try not to make any silly mistakes during practice, so… well, could you please guide me…?",
    "92005": "Even a little bit at a time… if we move forward, we can change… right?",
    "92006": "For the sake of my trainer who never gave up on me… I will grow even more!",
    "92007": "I thought I could show you a different me in training…! Maybe, just maybe… a little bit!",
    "92011": "But it's a training camp, and I hope you will train me hard…!",
    "92015": "I will do whatever it takes! And I know that the trainer's path is the right one…!",
    "92016": "Wow, let's use the power of the costume to turn them away so that nothing bad will happen to them…? I'm so excited…!",
    "92017": "Ugh… I'm fine. I just made the ribbon around her neck a little tighter so it wouldn't come loose… ugh.",
    "92018": "I'm different today. My heels are comfortable to walk on, and I've only fallen once…!",
    "92020": "It's difficult to become the person I want to be… But I don't want to give up…!",
    "92021": "Please let me know if there is anywhere you want to go…! I'll do my best to show you around!",
    "92022": "My trainer is my salvation… my guide… and I trust her with all my heart!",
    "93000": "Thanks to my trainer… I can live with my chest out～!",
    "93001": "Even for me… there was salvation～…!",
    "93004": "A future that has guided us… I hope we continue to move forward together!!!",
    "93005": "I was able to reach the goal without hesitation!",
    "95000": "I thought I had grown up a bit…!",
    "95001": "I…! I've changed so much…!",
    "95003": "Aww…! Meishoudou desu～!",
    "95004": "It's do-do-do-do-do-do-do! The dream is - eh, time is running out…!",
    "95005": "Oh, I don't know if I can help you…",
    "95006": "If I can be of any help…!",
    "95007": "Wow… it's like a fire was lit in my heart.",
    "95008": "You're guiding me all the way?",
    "95009": "I am the guide of souls… where am I?",
    "95010": "Meishoudou de suu. I believe we'll get there someday…!",
    "110000": "Um… what kind of training did you do today?",
    "110001": "It seems like there are lots of fun stories to tell!",
    "110002": "Les, do you want to enter the race…?",
    "120000": "It kind of… makes my heart flutter～!",
    "140000": "Fa, fight～!",
    "140001": "Wow!",
    "140002": "Hawaa…!",

    "400004": "What should I do? Because of my screw-up, I'm causing trouble for everyone again…",
    "400008": "I'm so nervous! But… I've done everything I could until today!",
    "400014": "Thank you for your hard work at the event! I hope I was able to bring happiness to everyone…!",

    "20029": "Well… I'm a little nervous, but I don't think it's a problem. I'm off.",

    "20034": "I don't feel comfortable… Maybe I'm in a bit of a hurry. …I have to run like myself.",
    "20035": "So many spectators… Oh my god…! Pull yourself together, Me!",
    "20036": "I can feel everyone's enthusiasm… I can feel everyone's enthusiasm…… I mustn't lose in spirit.",
    "20037": "Hey, what do I look like now? I don't know, don't tell me after all. I have to work hard anyway…",
    "20038": "Coming.",
    "20039": "Okay…!",
    "20040": "I'll do my best.",
    "20041": "Calm down…",
    "20042": "Oh no…!",

    "20047": "It's beautiful.",
    "20049": "We did a lot, a lot of hard work.",
    "20050": "Thanks, trainer.",
    "20051": "Just hang on and keep going…!",
    "20100": "…I feel kind of heavy. Oh, no, I'm fine. I'm fine like this.",
    "20101": "Huh… I guess I'm tired. Can I take a little rest first? I'll be able to work hard again after I do that.",
    "20106": "Okay, I'm going to try again today. Can you tell me what your plans are?",
    "20109": "I'm sorry. I just sighed. I'm just so motivated…",
    "20121": "What, another race? …I want to compete too, but I don't think I can win right now…",
    "20122": "Yes… But all those races have made me tired…",
    "20133": "To be honest, I'm a little nervous, but I'll do what I can.",
    "23015": "Okay…!",
    "30000": "It should still be possible…!",
    "30001": "I'm up there, too.",
    "30002": "I'll try harder and harder…!",
    "30003": "This can't end like this…!",
    "30004": "I'm not used to being proud of myself, but… not bad.",
    "30005": "I could do it… even me!",
    "30006": "Follow me. I'll take you to a better place next time.",
    "30007": "I could do it… even me!",
    "31000": "Just look at the goal…!",
    "40000": "I'm going where I'm going!",
    "40001": "The eyes surrounding me, the voices… Stop it! Yes, I'll go where I'm looking at…!",
    "40003": "I got you!",
    "40004": "Hmm? Wow… oh, wait! Wow! Thanks for showing me… ufufu♪",
    "60000": "It's okay, it's okay… I'll be there!",
    "60001": "I have to tell her how I feel…!",
    "70000": "Together, we will do our best, as much as possible…",
    "70001": "I was worried at first if I could get along with you… but now I'm fine. I'm used to it.",
    "70004": "I like them because they all have matching uniforms, and they're not needlessly conspicuous.",
    "70008": "I don't think I look good in such a cute outfit…",
    "70009": "This is the race outfit I choose for myself… I have to wear them with pride.",
    "70010": "If you wear this, it's easy to tell you're a student of Tracen Academy. We have to be firm…",
    "70014": "I am nervous to be on stage, but I have to show my appreciation.",
    "70015": "I'll make sure to run in a way that's appropriate for this outfit… I promise.",
    "70016": "Fresh wind, water… it's so nice to feel it directly.",
    "70017": "Where are you going next? We have to make plans, don't we?",
    "70018": "……～!",
    "70019": "I will run just like my ideal……!",
    "70101": "I was worried at first, but now that I've decided to work with a trainer, I'm fine.",
    "71004": "I like them because they all have matching uniforms, and they're not needlessly conspicuous.",
    "71008": "I don't think I look good in such a cute outfit…",

    "71018": "……～!",
    "71019": "I will run just like my ideal……!",
    "80000": "that's enough for today",
    "81000": "You want to race with me? … Okay, got it. I'll do my best!",
    "81001": "Great… but I can still do it! I won't let you down!",
    "90000": "Good morning. …What? I just said hello. Don't stare so much.",
    "90001": "It's hard to be graceful in the morning… I'm sleepy, I'm in a daze… McQueen is amazing.",
    "90002": "When I go out to lunch on my day off, everyone wears the cutest clothes… I can't do it.",
    "90003": "Can't we take a lunch break to work out? I'm not forcing myself.",
    "90004": "Are you still working until this late? You have another day tomorrow, so don't push yourself too hard and fall ill, okay?",
    "90005": "Hmmm… yawn… did you see my face just now? Forget it! Erase it from your memory.",
    "90006": "So many new students… They are so sparkling and dazzling that I might not be able to look at them directly…",
    "90007": "We have to watch out for the heat. If I fall down in front of everyone, I'll end up in the spotlight…",
    "90008": "I was thinking that I don't mind the smell of dead leaves, but then I smelled the aroma of baked potatoes coming from outside… did you think it was inside the school?",
    "90009": "Hey, don't get too close! Now there's static electricity.",
    "90010": "I'm not great at waing up, but… I have to get ready for a lot of things, so I just wake up while I'm doing it.",
    "90011": "Still sleepy? ……Why don't you put on something cool? It will wake you up a little.",
    "90012": "There's this café I want to go to. It's got a really nutritious menu… So… are we going? or not?",
    "90013": "Eating in an elegant way… isn't that something you learn when you are little? You don't want to be embarrassed at a dinner party…",
    "90014": "Do you need help with paperwork or something? I don't like the fact that you don't do anything when there is something you can do.",
    "90015": "…It's important to take a break once in a while. Why don't you go for a walk? The night air is so relaxing.",
    "90016": "You should be careful with the spring wind. If your hat or something gets blown away, it will be very hard to find it… I'll let you know.",
    "90017": "Don't yearn for a summer vacation… The sea breeze blows away your hat, and you find bottle mail on the beach … too dreamy…?",
    "90018": "Why don't we go to Kyoto to watch a race? It would be a good learning experience and the leaves will be changing soon……",
    "90019": "If you're cold, why don't you have something warm to drink? …I'll share a cup of ginger tea if you like.",
    "90020": "Happy…… Valentine's Day",
    "90021": "Happy…… Valentine's Day",
    "90100": "Good morning. …What? You're staring at me like that. Are you also sleeping in a bad habit?",
    "90103": "Can we use your lunch break for training? I'm fine, I'm not overworking myself.",
    "90104": "It's late… is trainer still working? Well, you know, don't take it too hard.",
    "90105": "Hmmm… yawn… did you see my face just now? Oh no… I'm so embarrassed…",
    "90109": "No, no, no, stay away from me! No, it's not that I don't want to, it's just that right now the static electricity is… oh no!",
    "90110": "How's it going? I think I did a little better with my hair…! I guess it was worth getting up early.",
    "90111": "Maybe you're still sleepy? …You should try to dress up in a cooler outfit. The morning breeze will make your eyes clearer.",
    "90112": "Hey, do you want to go to a cafe? I'd like to go out with you in this dress, and we can have tea together… how about that?",
    "90115": "Are you still working? …Why don't you come with me for a little walk? You might be more efficient if you take a break.",
    "90116": "Be careful of the spring wind. If you are careless and your hat gets blown off, you will have a hard time chasing after it…",
    "90118": "How about going to Kyoto to see the autumn leaves?",
    "90119": "If you feel cold, just let me know. I've got a pot of ginger tea for two.",
    "91000": "I told you to stop calling me \"Belle-chan\", but father… ah it's nothing!",
    "91001": "Don't ask me about my childhood. It's not all good memories.",
    "91002": "I has caused Ryan so much trouble in the past… I'm proud to say that I don't have to worry her anymore.",
    "91003": "Do you have younger siblings? Do you know how to deal with child… No, no, I'm just asking.",
    "91004": "The Mejiros are all very respectable. They are different from me.",
    "91005": "Everyone said I looked good in this outfit, but I'm sure they were just flattering.",
    "91006": "Tang, tang, turn… ♪ Fufu, fluffy… ah!? No, no, no, I was just practicing!",
    "91007": "It's a costume that I put my heart and soul into, I'm not going to run pathetically wearing this…!",
    "91008": "…Maybe it was a little too cute. No, no, it's a costume I decided on, I have to be proud of it…!",
    "91009": "Even if I want to train early in the morning, if I is not there when I get up from bed, Taiki is going to miss me…",
    "91010": "In the manga, they often make homemade lunches… I wonder if I can make them too…",
    "91011": "Training at night is so relaxing… I don't feel anyone looking at me and I can concentrate on my work…!",
    "91012": "…I like cherry blossom viewing. It's fun, it's beautiful, and everyone is paying attention to the cherry blossoms.",
    "91013": "I thought I heard something like thunder last night at midnight… haha, I like rain, but…",
    "91014": "If I'm not mistaken, today is a tea party with everyone in the Mejiro family under the autumn leaves.… Fufu, I'm looking forward to it.",
    "91015": "I cut back on sweets, and then… Oh no. Why do I gain weight so easily in the winter…!",
    "91016": "『You look super hot, like a model!』 Palmer, you are praising me too much…",
    "91017": "I like to go out with this, but I tend to take side trips and it takes a lot of time.",
    "91018": "You don't see my back right? I never thought that after a sunburn, my skin would never go away like this.",
    "91019": "It's soooo… nnn, it's nice. It's good for a change of pace, too.",
    "91020": "It's not safe to keep a bird of prey in a school in the first place… but they are such good friends… we have to take care of them anyway.",
    "91021": "Oh, the hair of the dog this morning. I've been seeing her on our walks lately… Hmmm, she's so cute and naughty!",
    "91022": "Is BBQ something you do every weekend? They always invite me… ah… or is that a joke from Taiki!",
    "91023": "Rob Roy said that reading a book before going to bed helps you sleep well… If you sleep well, you can thank Rob Roy.",
    "91024": "Hmmm. …What do you think? Would this make it easier for new students to talk to me? Should I raise the corners of my mouth a little more?",
    "91025": "The sun is shining, why don't you wear a hat? I'm thinking of something with a wide brim to prevent heat stroke… but don't wear the same hat…!",
    "91026": "I heard that most of the autumn leaves in England are yellow… No, I just looked it up because I have time on my hands. It's not that I want to go there…",
    "91027": "If I hide it with ribbons… no, no! I need to move and lose weight. I'll get rid of the excess flesh in the winter…!",
    "91028": "I would like to thank Ryan for these clothes. Maybe I can pick out the clothes this time? I'm going to go with something much cuter.",
    "91029": "This is the kind of hair set-up Bright does every day… I can't copy that fluffy look.",
    "91101": "I had some fun, but to be honest, I don't want to remember much of my childhood…",
    "91103": "Hey, hey, do you have younger siblings? I'd like you to tell me what I should do to make them happy.",
    "91104": "Everyone in the Mejiro family is so magnificent, and so admirable, but… I just can't… I just can't do it.",
    "91123": "Print is fine. If you read it before going to bed, you can get a good night's sleep… I'm paraphrasing from Rob Roy.",
    "91125": "When you go out in the summer, a wide-brimmed hat is the way to go! It's cooler, you don't get sunburned, and you can even match it up, right?",
    "91126": "I heard that the leaves in England are mostly yellow! The palace is absolutely beautiful…! Maybe we can go together sometime…?",
    "92000": "I'm ready, so get started right away.",
    "92001": "I don't care what's going on around me, I don't care… just focus on training…!",
    "92002": "I want to be strong. …That's why I choose you to be my trainer. So do it well.",
    "92003": "I'm not nervous or anything. I just want to run my race.",
    "92005": "Have you thought of a menu? Then tell me what to do. I'll make sure you get it right.",
    "92006": "I don't want you to be shy. So make me stronger.",
    "92007": "I trust you as a trainer… Just as trainer okay!",
    "92011": "If I'm going to train, it's now. I have to make sure I don't get left behind by everyone else…!",
    "92015": "All right. Now that the ribbons are tied, let's get to work.",
    "92016": "I wasn't expecting it because it's an athlete's nail polish, but looking at it this way, it's pretty stylish…!",
    "92017": "When I run in this dress, I feel like I'm the wind… and I don't have to worry about people's eyes on me.",
    "92018": "As a senior, I have to be a role model. I want to work harder.",
    "92020": "I'll do whatever it takes, even if it's on the perimeter. If I'm still worried about my surroundings,I still have a long way to go…!",
    "92021": "I feel like I don't mind being seen these days. Maybe it's because of the clothes Ryan picked out for me and thanks to a certain someone… a little?",
    "92022": "Hey, that place you said you were going next, is it somewhere you've been before? Or not? I don't care which one you've been to, but you need to decide quickly.",
    "92100": "I'm ready. We can start whenever you are.",
    "92102": "I want to be strong. …That's why I choose you to be my trainer. I'll leave the training to you.",
    "92105": "Have you thought of training menu? … Don't worry. I'll definitely get it done.",
    "92107": "I trust my trainer, and I intend to respond to that trust.",
    "92115": "All right. Now that the ribbons are tied up tight, we're ready to get started!",
    "92118": "I want to show the juniors that I'm doing my best as a senior. Even I can do it too, right?",
    "92121": "I feel like I don't mind being seen these days. I think it's because of the clothes Ryan picked out for me and the Trainer.",
    "92122": "Where were we going next? Somewhere you've been before? Or somewhere you haven't? I don't care which one, as long as we're together.",
    "93000": "I'm glad you're my trainer. No, it's nothing!",
    "93001": "I'm glad you're my trainer!",
    "93002": "Even like this I'm grateful okay… I… I'm not lying!",
    "93003": "I am grateful for this… thanks!",
    "93004": "I feel like we can go anywhere together… maybe.",
    "93005": "The best souvenirs may be the memories of the journey.",
    "93006": "Together, we can go anywhere!",
    "95000": "I can still do it…!",
    "95001": "I have to push my limits…!",
    "95003": "Mejiro Dober… Well, nice to meet you.",
    "95004": "I want to change…! That's why I keep running!",
    "95005": "I think I can do more.",
    "95006": "I want to help you, too.",
    "95007": "I want more… adventure!",
    "95008": "Since we're here, do you want to go somewhere to commemorate the occasion?",
    "95009": "Wanna go out somewhere? …just for a change, you know?",
    "95010": "Hat Good. …Mejiro Dober. Nice to meet you.",
    "110000": "You'll make me stronger right.",
    "110001": "It's a little embarrassing to remember the past…",
    "110002": "I need to gain experience and get used to racing…!",
    "120000": "This power… will not be wasted!",
    "140000": "Cute… which one, should I take?",
    "140001": "Yes!",
    "140002": "That's right…",
    "140003": "Amazing, so much!",
    "140004": "It could have been fun.",
    "140005": "I can't help it…",
    "140006": "Amazing, so much!",
    "140007": "It could have been fun.",
    "140008": "Hmmm…",
    "140009": "Haha…",
    "140010": "Damn…",
    "140011": "That was amazing.",
    "140012": "I did it…!",
    "140013": "Whoa…!",
    "140014": "How did you…!",
    "140015": "Hmmm…",
    "140016": "Are you nervous?",
    "140017": "Aaah～!",
    "140018": "Hey, ugh…",
    "400000": "Included in the barbecue plan, fishing rods and bicycles are available for rent…! You'll have a great time!",
    "400004": "If it's the strength of feelings, I won't lose even to Airgroove. I want to change. I want to be strong.",
    "400008": "Summer nights are strange. I feel like I can be a little more honest.",
    "400010": "Taiki gave me a lot of pictures. There were so many photos that I wondered when she took them.",
    "400012": "It's event mission. I'm also going to do my best",
    "400013": "Good job on the event mission. You should receive your reward. It's a proof of your hard work.",
    "400014": "Whew… I think I'll go to bed early today. But first. Let's go tell Ryan about the camp."

    "10009": "Oh. You're working during the holidays? Well, I guess a certain kind-hearted Santa Claus can bring you some turkey.",
